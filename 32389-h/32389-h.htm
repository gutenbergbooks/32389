<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT are the best fairy stories?
Are they not those which have
lived most vividly in active minds?
The ripeness of after life works its
changes; but we are not dealing with
literary judgments&mdash;rather with the
choice of childhood which fortunately
lingers in memory, whatever store of
wisdom may come in later years. There
is here no question of the new or unusual.
On the contrary, it is the ideas
or visions handed down for generations
or centuries and set in final form that
remain with us as types of fancy or
wisdom. Of these there are so many
that a selection is essential. No one
book can be a complete treasure-house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>x]</a></span>
of all the imagination, humor, and sentiment
of the fairy tale. But it has
been possible to obtain a representative
judgment for this volume which we believe
to be of peculiar worth.</p>

<p>This book gives us the favorite fairy
tales of men and women who have
gained eminence in American life. It
is a book, therefore, based upon an
original plan, which stands by itself.
Any collection formed by one person
must reflect personal preferences. It
must have obvious limitations, however
excellent&mdash;as in the case of Miss Mulock
or Laboulaye&mdash;the choice of the single
editor may be. But to a large extent
such a collection as this represents that
consensus of opinion which invests a
given work with the rank of a classic.
The desire of the publishers has been to
determine the youthful preferences of
those whose opinions carry weight and
to present their selections among the
wealth of fairy tales which the world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xi]</a></span>
cherishes from one generation to another.
Such a thing as a collection of
<em>all</em> good fairy tales would be unthinkably
cumbersome. We need guidance
and selection. For the expressions of
personal choice afforded in the interests
of this book, the publishers desire to offer
their grateful acknowledgments.</p>

<p>It has happened naturally that more
than one vote has been cast for the
same story. For example, the president
of Yale, in his selection of &ldquo;Jack
the Giant-killer,&rdquo; had the companionship
of the president of Columbia and
of the editor of <i>Harper&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, who
are really represented, therefore, by a
second choice. The three stories preferred
by the chairman of the Wisconsin
Free Library Commission had all
been preferred by others.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;Cinderella&rdquo; is evidently quite
the equal of &ldquo;Jack the Giant-killer&rdquo; in
the affections of readers, and the choice
of this well-loved tale has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xii]</a></span>
accompanied by some charming letters from
which it is impossible not to quote.</p>

<p>Thus the Hon. John Bigelow writes:
&ldquo;Perrault&rsquo;s story of Cinderella made
the deepest impression upon me. It
is the only one from which I can now
remember to have received a distinct
and permanent ethical impression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not really conscious of any
special preference for one fairy story
over another,&rdquo; wrote Professor Lounsbury,
&ldquo;but as somebody, it seems to
me, ought to stand up for sentiment,
I am going to vote for &lsquo;Cinderella.&rsquo; I
hesitated a moment about &lsquo;The Sleeping
Beauty,&rsquo; but I leave that for one
younger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a letter rich in personal quality,
the Hon. Grover Cleveland wrote: &ldquo;My
youthful days are so far away, and fairy
stories had so little to do with their
enjoyment, that I do not feel that I
ought to venture an opinion on such
an important subject as that to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiii]</a></span>
you refer. For want of a better thing
to do, I have submitted the question
to my children, and so far as I am able
to determine, the canvass of their votes
is in favor of &lsquo;Cinderella.&rsquo; It is only
fair to say that two of the three to
whom the question was submitted are
little girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another glimpse of domestic sympathy
comes in the choice of the Hon.
William J. Bryan, editor and author,
as well as publicist, who says: &ldquo;My wife
assures me that I shall make no mistake
if I commend the tales of Hans Christian
Andersen, notably that of &lsquo;The
Ugly Duckling.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is a change from public life to the
world of letters to find Dr. Van Dyke
and Dr. Mabie in agreement with Dr.
Shailer Mathews regarding the rank of
&ldquo;The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood.&rdquo;
But it is not to this that Dr. Van Dyke
gives precedence. &ldquo;If my memory
serves me right,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xiv]</a></span>
fairy story which made a strong impression
on my mind in boyhood was that
of &lsquo;Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp.&rsquo;
Next after that in time, and, I think, a
little beyond it in interest, came the
story of the &lsquo;Seven Wild Swans,&rsquo; and
next to that the story of &lsquo;The Sleeping
Beauty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to &ldquo;Hop o&rsquo; My Thumb&rdquo; we may
be pardoned for quoting the close of a
singularly delightful letter from Mr.
Henry James, who says: &ldquo;It is the
vague memory of this sense of him, as
some small, precious object, like a lost
gem or a rare and beautiful insect on
which one might inadvertently tread,
or might find under the sofa or behind
the window-cushion, that leads me to
think of &lsquo;Hop o&rsquo; My Thumb&rsquo; as my
earliest and sweetest and most repeated
cupful at the fount of fiction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quite literally a world removed from
this was the answer of the modest Japanese
conqueror, General Kuroki, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xv]</a></span>
laughed at first and disclaimed Japan&rsquo;s
possession of fairy tales as we understand
them. &ldquo;I always tried to forget
fairy tales,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but of nursery
stories I think the most popular and
the most widely known in Japan is the
story of Momotaro.&rdquo; But this tale of
the &ldquo;son of a peach,&rdquo; which relates the
conquest of a stronghold of devils, and
the rescue of two daughters of daimios
does not come within the scope of this
volume.</p>

<p>A broader choice than those which
have been quoted is afforded by Mrs.
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, who
writes: &ldquo;As a child I was a great reader
and lover (and a small creator) of fairy
tales. But of them all the only ones
which come readily to my mind are
Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Equally
comprehensive is the answer of Mrs.
Georgia A. Kendrick, the lady principal
of Vassar College: &ldquo;Grimm&rsquo;s tales stand
to me for the best of that kind of lore.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvi]</a></span>
An even more catholic liking breathes
in the answer of President Woodrow
Wilson, who declares: &ldquo;The truth is that
I was so voracious of fairy tales when
I was a small boy, that I loved them
all almost equally well, and cannot
now say that I had any favorite. All
was grist that came to my mill. I am
very much interested in the undertaking,
and wish it all success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In some cases, much to the regret of
the publishers, it has not been possible
to include a choice. Thus Dr. John
S. Billings, librarian of the New York
Public Library, tells us that the story
which made the most impression upon
him was the &ldquo;Nibelungenlied&rdquo; as presented
by Carlyle in the <i>Westminster
Review</i> for July, 1831, of which
an odd number came in his way when
he was a boy. &ldquo;I did not understand
one quarter of it,&rdquo; Dr. Billings writes,
&ldquo;but what I did impressed me greatly.
If I had to select from Perrault&rsquo;s fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xvii]</a></span>
tales, I should probably agree with
Dr. Hadley&rdquo;&mdash;another tribute to the
perennial charm of &ldquo;Jack the Giant-killer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The interest of these personal literary
experiences justify a quotation from
Dr. E.&nbsp;G. Cooley, superintendent of the
Chicago schools: &ldquo;I was pretty well
grown,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;before any of this
literature reached me. My people were
not believers in fairy stories, and circumstances
did not put them in my
way. My boyhood hero was Eumenes,
as described in the second volume of
Rollin&rsquo;s <i>Ancient History</i>.&rdquo; Unfortunately
the scope of the present volume
has not permitted the inclusion of Carlyle&rsquo;s
version of the &ldquo;Nibelungenlied&rdquo;
or of Rollin&rsquo;s tale of Eumenes, or of
the old ballad of &ldquo;The Children in the
Wood,&rdquo; which was the choice of Dr.
W.&nbsp;H. Maxwell, City Superintendent of
Schools in New York.</p>

<p>While the reply of that sincere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xviii]</a></span>
nature-lover, John Burroughs, represents
a gospel of negation, yet there is a vivid
suggestiveness in the later interest of
the man&mdash;one whose sympathies and
perception have remained fresh and
wholly sincere. &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; he
writes, &ldquo;I knew no fairy stories in my
youth. That kind of literature did not
come within my reach. Our school library
held no novels or fairy books. An
old woman who visited our house used
to tell us youngsters the story of &lsquo;Jack
and the Bean-stalk,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jack the
Giant-killer,&rsquo; &lsquo;Bluebeard,&rsquo; etc. When I
had a boy of my own, I used to read
Hans Christian Andersen to him, and
get quite as much interested as he did.
I do not recall that I ever read any
fairy tales before Andersen&rsquo;s, and did
not read these till past middle life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may be said again that while this
book lays no claim to comprehensiveness,
we believe that its personal guidance
represents a high value which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>xix]</a></span>
fitly reinforced by the distinctive imagination
of Mr. Peter Newell. In the
light of his quaint fancy, unexpected
humor, and sympathetic insight, these
classic tales reveal a new store of riches,
and are clothed with a charm which
even those of us who love them had not
foreseen.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases these stories
reproduce the excellent versions given
in Miss Mulock&rsquo;s <i>Fairy Book</i> (Harper
&amp; Brothers). But the publishers desire
to acknowledge the courtesy of
Messrs. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., for their
permission to reproduce the admirable
versions of &ldquo;Aladdin,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Forty
Thieves,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Story of the Three
Bears&rdquo; from their <i>Blue and Green Fairy
Books</i>, edited by Mr. Andrew Lang.
The &ldquo;Second Voyage of Sindbad the
Sailor&rdquo; is from the series edited by
Mr. W.&nbsp;T. Stead, entitled, <i>Books for
the Bairns</i>.</p>

<h2>JACK THE GIANT-KILLER</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the reign of the famous King
Arthur, there lived, near the Land&rsquo;s
End of England, in the county of Cornwall,
a worthy farmer who had an only
son named Jack. Jack was a boy of
a bold temper; he took pleasure in hearing
or reading stories of wizards, conjurors,
giants, and fairies, and used to
listen eagerly while his father talked
of the great deeds of the brave knights
of King Arthur&rsquo;s Round Table. When
Jack was sent to take care of the sheep
and oxen in the fields, he used to
to amuse himself with planning battles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
sieges, and the means to conquer or surprise
a foe. He was above the common
sports of children, but hardly any one
could equal him at wrestling; or, if he
met with a match for himself in strength,
his skill and address always made him
the victor.</p>

<p>In those days there lived on St.
Michael&rsquo;s Mount, of Cornwall, which
rises out of the sea at some distance
from the main-land, a huge giant. He
was eighteen feet high and three yards
round, and his fierce and savage looks
were the terror of all his neighbors.
He dwelt in a gloomy cavern on the
very top of the mountain, and used to
wade over to the main-land in search of
his prey. When he came near, the people
left their houses; and after he had
glutted his appetite upon their cattle
he would throw half a dozen oxen upon
his back, and tie three times as many
sheep and hogs round his waist, and so
march back to his own abode.</p>

<div class="figcenter ipadtop" style="width: 388px;">
<a name="breakfast" id="breakfast"></a>
<img src="images/fft03.jpg" width="388" height="600"
alt="The giant strides towards Jack" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;I will broil you for my breakfast&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
The giant had done this for many
years, and the coast of Cornwall was
greatly hurt by his thefts, when Jack boldly
resolved to destroy him. He therefore
took a horn, a shovel, a pickaxe, and a
dark lantern, and early in a long winter&rsquo;s
evening he swam to the Mount. There
he fell to work at once, and before morning
he had dug a pit twenty-two feet
deep and almost as many broad. He
covered it over with sticks and straw,
and strewed some of the earth over
them, to make it look just like solid
ground. He then put his horn to his
mouth, and blew such a loud and long
tantivy that the giant awoke and came
towards Jack, roaring like thunder:
&ldquo;You saucy villain, you shall pay dearly
for breaking my rest; I will broil you
for my breakfast.&rdquo; He had scarcely
spoken these words when he came advancing
one step farther; but then he
tumbled headlong into the pit, and his
fall shook the very mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oho, Mr. Giant!&rdquo; said Jack, looking
into the pit, &ldquo;have you found your way
so soon to the bottom? How is your
appetite now? Will nothing serve you
for breakfast this cold morning but
broiling poor Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant now tried to rise, but Jack
struck him a blow on the crown of the
head with his pickaxe, which killed him
at once. Jack then made haste back to
rejoice his friends with the news of the
giant&rsquo;s death. When the justices of
Cornwall heard of this valiant action,
they sent for Jack, and declared that
he should always be called Jack the
Giant-killer; and they also gave him a
sword and belt, upon which was written,
in letters of gold:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;This is the valiant Cornishman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who slew the giant Cormoran.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The news of Jack&rsquo;s exploits soon
spread over the western parts of England;
and another giant, called Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
Blunderbore, vowed to have revenge on
Jack if it should ever be his fortune to
get him into his power. The giant kept
an enchanted castle in the midst of a
lonely wood. About four months after
the death of Cormoran, as Jack was taking
a journey into Wales, he passed
through this wood, and as he was very
weary he sat down to rest by the side of
a pleasant fountain, and there he fell
into a deep sleep. The giant came to
the fountain for water just at this time
and found Jack there; and as the lines
on Jack&rsquo;s belt showed who he was, the
giant lifted him up and laid him gently
upon his shoulder to carry him to his
castle; but as he passed through the
thicket the rustling of the leaves waked
Jack, and he was sadly afraid when he
found himself in the clutches of Blunderbore.</p>

<p>Yet this was nothing to his fright
soon after; for when they reached the
castle he beheld the floor covered all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
over with the skulls and bones of men
and women. The giant took him into
a large room, where lay the hearts and
limbs of persons who had been lately
killed; and he told Jack, with a horrid
grin, that men&rsquo;s hearts, eaten with pepper
and vinegar, were his nicest food,
and, also, that he thought he should
make a dainty meal on his heart. When
he had said this he locked Jack up in
that room, while he went to fetch another
giant, who lived in the same wood,
to enjoy a dinner off Jack&rsquo;s flesh with him.
While he was away, Jack heard dreadful
shrieks, groans, and cries from many parts
of the castle; and soon after he heard a
mournful voice repeat these lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Haste, valiant stranger, haste away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest you become the giant&rsquo;s prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his return he&rsquo;ll bring another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still more savage than his brother;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horrid, cruel monster who,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before he kills, will torture you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, valiant stranger! haste away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or you&rsquo;ll become these giants&rsquo; prey.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
This warning was so shocking to poor
Jack that he was ready to go mad. He
ran to the window and saw the two
giants coming along arm in arm. This
window was right over the gates of the
castle. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; thought Jack, &ldquo;either
my death or freedom is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were two strong cords in the
room. Jack made a large noose with
a slip-knot at the ends of both these,
and, as the giants were coming through
the gates, he threw the ropes over their
heads. He then made the other ends
fast to a beam in the ceiling, and pulled
with all his might, till he had almost
strangled them. When he saw that
they were both black in the face, and
had not the least strength left, he drew
his sword and slid down the ropes; he
then killed the giants, and thus saved
himself from a cruel death. Jack next
took a great bunch of keys from the
pocket of Blunderbore, and went into the
castle again. He made a strict search
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
through all the rooms, and in them found
three ladies tied up by the hair of their
heads, and almost starved to death.
They told him that their husbands had
been killed by the giants, who had then
condemned them to be starved to death,
because they would not eat the flesh of
their own dead husbands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I have put an
end to the monster and his wicked
brother; and I give you this castle and
all the riches it contains, to make you
some amends for the dreadful pains
you have felt.&rdquo; He then very politely
gave them the keys of the castle, and
went farther on his journey to Wales.</p>

<p>As Jack had not taken any of the
giant&rsquo;s riches for himself, and had very
little money of his own, he thought it
best to travel as fast as he could. At
length he lost his way, and when night
came on he was in a lonely valley between
two lofty mountains. There he
walked about for some hours, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
seeing any dwelling-place, so he thought
himself very lucky at last in finding a
large and handsome house. He went
up to it boldly, and knocked loudly at
the gate; when, to his great terror and
surprise, there came forth a monstrous
giant with two heads. He spoke to
Jack very civilly, for he was a Welsh
giant, and all the mischief he did was
by private and secret malice, under the
show of friendship and kindness.</p>

<p>Jack told him that he was a traveller
who had lost his way, on which the huge
monster made him welcome, and led him
into a room where there was a good bed
in which to pass the night. Jack took off
his clothes quickly; but though he was
so weary he could not go to sleep. Soon
after this he heard the giant walking
backward and forward in the next room,
and saying to himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Though here you lodge with me this night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You shall not see the morning light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My club shall dash your brains out quite.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
&ldquo;Say you so?&rdquo; thought Jack. &ldquo;Are
these your tricks upon travellers? But
I hope to prove as cunning as you.&rdquo;
Then, getting out of bed, he groped about
the room, and at last found a large, thick
billet of wood; he laid it in his own place
in the bed, and hid himself in a dark
corner of the room. In the middle of
the night the giant came with his great
club, and struck many heavy blows on
the bed, in the very place where Jack
had laid the billet, and then he went
back to his own room, thinking he had
broken all his bones. Early in the
morning Jack put a bold face upon the
matter, and walked into the giant&rsquo;s
room to thank him for his lodging.</p>

<p>The giant started when he saw him,
and he began to stammer out: &ldquo;Oh,
dear me! is it you? Pray how did you
sleep last night? Did you hear or see
anything in the dead of the night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing worth speaking of,&rdquo; said
Jack, carelessly; &ldquo;a rat, I believe, gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
me three or four slaps with his tail, and
disturbed me a little, but I soon went
to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant wondered more and more
at this, yet he did not answer a word,
and went to bring two great bowls of
hasty-pudding for their breakfast.</p>

<p>Jack wished to make the giant believe
that he could eat as much as himself,
so he contrived to button a leathern bag
inside his coat, and slipped the hasty-pudding
into this bag, while he seemed
to put it into his mouth. When breakfast
was over, he said to the giant,
&ldquo;Now I will show you a fine trick; I
can cure all wounds with a touch; I
could cut off my head one minute, and
the next put it sound again on my
shoulders; you shall see an example.&rdquo;
He then took hold of the knife, ripped
up the leathern bag, and all the hasty-pudding
tumbled out upon the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ods splutter hur nails,&rdquo; cried the
Welsh giant, who was ashamed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
outdone by such a little fellow as Jack;
&ldquo;hur can do that hurself.&rdquo; So he
snatched up the knife, plunged it into
his stomach, and in a moment dropped
down dead.</p>

<p>As soon as Jack had thus tricked the
Welsh monster, he went farther on his
journey; and a few days after he met
with King Arthur&rsquo;s only son, who had
got his father&rsquo;s leave to travel into
Wales, to deliver a beautiful lady from
the power of a wicked magician, by
whom she was held in enchantment.
When Jack found that the young prince
had no servants with him, he begged
leave to attend him; and the prince at
once agreed to this, and gave Jack many
thanks for his kindness.</p>

<p>King Arthur&rsquo;s son was a handsome,
polite, and brave knight, and so good-natured
that he gave money to everybody
he met. At length he gave his
last penny to an old woman, and then
turned to Jack. &ldquo;How shall we be able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
to get food for ourselves the rest of our
journey?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me, sir,&rdquo; replied Jack;
&ldquo;I will provide for my prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Night now came on, and the prince
began to grow uneasy at thinking where
they should lodge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;be of good heart;
two miles farther lives a large giant,
whom I know well; he has three heads,
and will fight five hundred men, and
make them fly before him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried the king&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;we had
better never have been born than meet
with such a monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, leave me to manage him,
and wait here in quiet till I return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince now stayed behind, while
Jack rode on at full speed; and when he
came to the gates of the castle he gave
a loud knock. The giant, with a voice
like thunder, roared out, &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack made answer, and said, &ldquo;No one
but your poor cousin Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;what news,
Cousin Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear uncle,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I have
heavy news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;what heavy
news can come to me? I am a giant
with three heads, and can fight five hundred
men, and make them fly before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s the king&rsquo;s
son coming with two thousand men to
kill you, and to destroy the castle and
all that you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Cousin Jack,&rdquo; said the giant,
&ldquo;this is heavy news indeed! But I have
a large cellar underground, where I will
hide myself, and you shall lock, bolt,
and bar me in, and keep the keys till
the king&rsquo;s son is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, when Jack had barred the giant
fast in the vault, he went back and
fetched the prince to the castle; they
both made themselves merry with the
wine and other dainties that were in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
house. So that night they rested very
pleasantly while the poor giant lay
trembling and shaking with fear in the
cellar underground. Early in the morning
Jack gave the king&rsquo;s son gold and
silver out of the giant&rsquo;s treasure, and
accompanied him three miles forward
on his journey. The prince then sent
Jack to let his uncle out of the hole, who
asked him what he should give him as
a reward for saving his castle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, good uncle,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I
desire nothing but the old coat and cap,
with the old rusty sword and slippers,
which are hanging at your bed&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the giant, &ldquo;you shall
have them; and pray keep them for my
sake, for they are things of great use.
The coat will keep you invisible, the
cap will give you knowledge, the sword
will cut through anything, and the shoes
are of vast swiftness; they may be useful
to you in all times of danger, so take
them with all my heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
Jack gave many thanks to the giant,
and then set off to the prince. When
he had come up to the king&rsquo;s son, they
soon arrived at the dwelling of the beautiful
lady, who was under the power of
a wicked magician. She received the
prince very politely and made a noble
feast for him; when it was ended, she
rose, and, wiping her mouth with a fine
handkerchief, said, &ldquo;My lord, you must
submit to the custom of my palace; to-morrow
morning I command you to tell
me on whom I bestow this handkerchief,
or lose your head.&rdquo; She then left the
room.</p>

<p>The young prince went to bed very
mournful, but Jack put on his cap of
knowledge, which told him that the
lady was forced, by the power of enchantment,
to meet the wicked magician
every night in the middle of the forest.
Jack now put on his coat of darkness
and his shoes of swiftness and was
there before her. When the lady came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
she gave the handkerchief to the magician.
Jack, with his sword of sharpness,
at one blow cut off his head; the
enchantment was then ended in a moment,
and the lady was restored to her
former virtue and goodness. She was
married to the prince on the next day,
and soon after went back, with her royal
husband and a great company, to the
court of King Arthur, where they were
received with loud and joyful welcomes;
and the valiant hero Jack, for the many
great exploits he had done for the good
of his country, was made one of the
Knights of the Round Table.</p>

<p>As Jack had been so lucky in all his
adventures, he resolved not to be idle
for the future, but still to do what services
he could for the honor of the king
and the nation. He therefore humbly
begged his majesty to furnish him with
a horse and money, that he might travel
in search of new and strange exploits.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he to the king, &ldquo;there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
many giants yet living in the remote
parts of Wales, to the great terror and
distress of your majesty&rsquo;s subjects;
therefore, if it please you, sire, to favor
me in my design, I will soon rid your
kingdom of these giants and monsters
in human shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now when the king heard this offer,
and began to think of the cruel deeds
of these blood-thirsty giants and savage
monsters, he gave Jack everything
proper for such a journey. After this,
Jack took leave of the king, the prince,
and all the knights, and set off, taking
with him his cap of knowledge, his sword
of sharpness, his shoes of swiftness, and
his invisible coat, the better to perform
the great exploits that might fall in his
way. He went along over hills and
mountains, and on the third day he
came to a wide forest. He had hardly
entered it when on a sudden he heard
dreadful shrieks and cries, and, forcing
his way through the trees, saw a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>19]</a></span>
monstrous giant dragging along by the hair
of their heads a handsome knight and a
beautiful lady. Their tears and cries
melted the heart of honest Jack; he
alighted from his horse, and, tying him
to an oak-tree, put on his invisible coat,
under which he carried his sword of
sharpness.</p>

<p>When he came up to the giant he
made several strokes at him, but could
not reach his body on account of the
enormous height of the terrible creature;
but he wounded his thighs in several
places, and at length, putting both hands
to his sword, and aiming with all his
might, he cut off both the giant&rsquo;s legs
just below the garter; and the trunk of
his body, tumbling to the ground, made
not only the trees shake, but the earth
itself tremble with the force of his fall.
Then Jack, setting his foot upon his
neck, exclaimed, &ldquo;Thou barbarous and
savage wretch, behold, I come to execute
upon thee the just reward for all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
thy crimes,&rdquo; and instantly plunged his
sword into the giant&rsquo;s body. The huge
monster gave a groan, and yielded up
his life into the hands of the victorious
Jack the Giant-killer, while the noble
knight and the virtuous lady were both
joyful spectators of his sudden death.
They not only returned Jack hearty
thanks for their deliverance, but also
invited him to their house, to refresh
himself after his dreadful encounter, as
likewise to receive a reward for his good
services.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I cannot be at
ease till I find out the den that was the
monster&rsquo;s habitation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knight, on hearing this, grew very
sorrowful, and replied: &ldquo;Noble stranger,
it is too much to run a second hazard;
this monster lived in a den under yonder
mountain, with a brother of his, more
fierce and cruel than himself; therefore,
if you should go thither, and perish in
the attempt, it would be a heart-breaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
thing to me and my lady; so let me
persuade you to go back with us, and
desist from any further pursuit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Jack, &ldquo;if there be
another, even if there were twenty, I
would shed the last drop of blood in my
body before one of them should escape.
When I have finished this task, I will
come and pay my respects to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So when they had told him where to
find them again, he got on his horse and
went after the dead giant&rsquo;s brother.</p>

<p>Jack had not ridden a mile and a half
before he came in sight of the mouth of
the cavern, and nigh the entrance of it
he saw the other giant sitting on a huge
block of timber, with a knotted iron
club lying by his side, waiting for his
brother. His eyes looked like flames
of fire, his face was grim and ugly, and
his cheeks were like two flitches of bacon;
the bristles of his beard seemed to be
thick rods of iron wire, and his long locks
of hair hung down upon his broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
shoulders like curling snakes. Jack got
down from his horse and turned him
into a thicket; then he put on his coat
of darkness and drew a little nearer
to behold this figure, and said, softly,
&ldquo;Oh, monster! are you there? It will
not be long before I shall take you fast
by the beard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant all this while could not see
him, by reason of his invisible coat, so
Jack came quite close to him, and struck
a blow at his head with his sword of
sharpness; but he missed his aim, and
only cut off his nose, which made him
roar like loud claps of thunder. He
rolled his glaring eyes round on every
side, but could not see who had given
him the blow; so he took up his iron
club, and began to lay about him like
one that was mad with pain and fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;if this be the
case, I will kill you at once.&rdquo; So saying,
he slipped nimbly behind him, and
jumping upon the block of timber, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
the giant rose from it, he stabbed him
in the back, when, after a few howls, he
dropped down dead. Jack cut off his
head and sent it, with the head of his
brother, to King Arthur by a wagon
which he had hired for that purpose.
When Jack had thus killed these two
monsters, he went into their cave in
search of their treasure. He passed
through many turnings and windings,
which led him to a room paved with
freestone; at the end of it was a boiling
caldron, and on the right hand stood
a large table, where the giants used to
dine. He then came to a window that
was secured with iron bars, through
which he saw a number of wretched captives,
who cried out when they saw
Jack, &ldquo;Alas! alas! young man, you
are come to be one among us in this
horrid den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;you will not
stay here long; but pray tell me what
is the meaning of your being here at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said one poor old man, &ldquo;I
will tell you, sir. We are persons that
have been taken by the giants who hold
this cave, and are kept till they choose
to have a feast; then one of us is to be
killed, and cooked to please their taste.
It is not long since they took three for
the same purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;I have given
them such a dinner that it will be
long enough before they have any
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captives were amazed at his
words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may believe me,&rdquo; said Jack,
&ldquo;for I have killed them both with the
edge of this sword, and have sent their
large heads to the court of King Arthur,
as marks of my great success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To show that what he said was true,
he unlocked the gate and set the captives
all free. Then he led them to the
great room, placed them round the
table, and placed before them two quarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
of beef, with bread and wine, upon
which they feasted their fill. When
supper was over they searched the
giant&rsquo;s coffers, and Jack divided among
them all the treasures. The next morning
they set off to their homes, and Jack
to the knight&rsquo;s house, whom he had left
with his lady not long before.</p>

<p>He was received with the greatest joy
by the thankful knight and his lady,
who, in honor of Jack&rsquo;s exploits, gave
a grand feast, to which all the nobles
and gentry were invited. When the
company were assembled, the knight
declared to them the great actions of
Jack, and gave him, as a mark of respect,
a fine ring, on which was engraved
the picture of the giant dragging
the knight and the lady by the hair,
with this motto round it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Behold in dire distress were we,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Under a giant&rsquo;s fierce command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gained our lives and liberty<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From valiant Jack&rsquo;s victorious hand.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Among the guests then present were
five aged gentlemen, who were fathers
to some of those captives who had been
freed by Jack from the dungeon of the
giants. As soon as they heard that he
was the person who had done such wonders,
they pressed round him with tears
of joy, to return him thanks for the happiness
he had caused them. After this
the bowl went round, and every one
drank the health and long life of the
gallant hero. Mirth increased, and the
hall was filled with peals of laughter.</p>

<p>But, on a sudden, a herald, pale and
breathless, rushed into the midst of the
company, and told them that Thundel,
a savage giant with two heads, had heard
of the death of his two kinsmen, and was
come to take his revenge on Jack, and
that he was now within a mile of the
house, the people flying before him like
chaff before the wind. At this news the
very boldest of the guests trembled;
but Jack drew his sword, and said: &ldquo;Let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
him come; I have a rod for him also.
Pray, ladies and gentlemen, do me the
favor to walk into the garden, and you
shall soon behold the giant&rsquo;s defeat and
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To this they all agreed, and heartily
wished him success in his dangerous
attempt.</p>

<p>The knight&rsquo;s house stood in the middle
of a moat, thirty feet deep and twenty
wide, over which lay a drawbridge. Jack
set men to work to cut the bridge on
both sides, almost to the middle, and
then dressed himself in his coat of darkness
and went against the giant with
his sword of sharpness. As he came
close to him, though the giant could not
see him for his invisible coat, yet he
found some danger was near, which
made him cry out:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Fa, fe, fi, fo, fum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I smell the blood of an Englishman;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him be alive, or let him be dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&rsquo;ll grind his bones to make me bread.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
&ldquo;Say you so, my friend?&rdquo; said Jack;
&ldquo;you are a monstrous miller, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art thou,&rdquo; cried the giant, &ldquo;the villain
that killed my kinsmen? Then I
will tear thee with my teeth and grind
thy bones to powder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must catch me first,&rdquo; said Jack;
and throwing off his coat of darkness,
and putting on his shoes of swiftness
he began to run, the giant following him
like a walking castle, making the earth
shake at every step.</p>

<p>Jack led him round and round the
walls of the house, that the company
might see the monster; then, to finish
the work, he ran over the drawbridge,
the giant going after him with his club;
but when he came to the middle, where
the bridge had been cut on both sides,
the great weight of his body made it
break, and he tumbled into the water,
where he rolled about like a large whale.
Jack now stood by the side of the moat,
and laughed and jeered at him, saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think you told me you would grind
my bones to powder; when will you begin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The giant foamed at both his horrid
mouths with fury, and plunged from
side to side of the moat; but he could
not get out to have revenge on his little
foe. At last Jack ordered a cart-rope to
be brought to him: he then drew it over
the giant&rsquo;s two heads, and, by the help
of a team of horses, dragged him to the
edge of the moat, where he cut off his
heads; and before he either ate or drank,
sent them both to the court of King
Arthur. He then went back to the
table with the company, and the rest
of the day was spent in mirth and good
cheer.</p>

<p>After staying with the knight for some
time, Jack grew weary of such an idle
life, and set out again in search of new
adventures. He went over hills and
dales without meeting any, till he came
to the foot of a very high mountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
Here he knocked at the door of a small
and lonely house, and an old man, with
a head as white as snow, let him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good father,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;can you
lodge a traveller who has lost his way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the hermit, &ldquo;I can, if you
will accept such fare as my poor house
affords.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack entered, and the old man set before
him some bread and fruit for his
supper. When Jack had eaten as much
as he chose, the hermit said: &ldquo;My son,
I know you are the famous conqueror
of giants; now, at the top of this mountain
is an enchanted castle, kept by a
giant named Galligantus, who, by the
help of a vile magician, gets many
knights into his castle, where he changes
them into the shape of beasts. Above
all, I lament the hard fate of a duke&rsquo;s
daughter, whom they seized as she was
walking in her father&rsquo;s garden, and
brought hither through the air in a
chariot drawn by two fiery dragons, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
turned her into the shape of a deer.
Many knights have tried to destroy the
enchantment and deliver her, yet none
have been able to do it, by reason of
two fiery griffins, who guard the gate
of the castle, and destroy all who come
nigh; but as you, my son, have an invisible
coat, you may pass by them
without being seen; and on the gates of
the castle you will find engraved by what
means the enchantment may be broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack promised that in the morning,
at the risk of his life, he would break
the enchantment; and after a sound
sleep he arose early, put on his invisible
coat, and got ready for the attempt.
When he had climbed to the top of the
mountain he saw the two fiery griffins;
but he passed between them without
the least fear of danger, for they could
not see him because of his invisible coat.
On the castle gate he found a golden
trumpet, under which were written these
lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Whoever can this trumpet blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall cause the giant&rsquo;s overthrow.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>As soon as Jack had read this he
seized the trumpet and blew a shrill
blast, which made the gates fly open
and the very castle itself tremble. The
giant and the conjuror now knew that
their wicked course was at an end, and
they stood biting their thumbs and shaking
with fear. Jack, with his sword of
sharpness, soon killed the giant, and the
magician was then carried away by a
whirlwind. All the knights and beautiful
ladies, who had been changed into
birds and beasts, returned to their proper
shapes. The castle vanished away like
smoke, and the head of the giant Galligantus
was sent to King Arthur. The
knights and ladies rested that night at
the old man&rsquo;s hermitage, and the next
day they set out for the court. Jack
then went up to the king, and gave his
majesty an account of all his fierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
battles. Jack&rsquo;s fame had spread through
the whole country, and at the king&rsquo;s
desire the duke gave him his daughter
in marriage, to the joy of all the kingdom.
After this the king gave him a
large estate, on which he and his lady
lived the rest of their days in joy and
content.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once an honest gentleman
who took for his second wife a
lady, the proudest and most disagreeable
in the whole country. She had
two daughters exactly like herself in
all things. He also had one little girl,
who resembled her dead mother, the
best woman in all the world. Scarcely
had the second marriage taken place
than the stepmother became jealous
of the good qualities of the little girl,
who was so great a contrast to her own
two daughters. She gave her all the
menial occupations of the house:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
compelled her to wash the floors and staircases,
to dust the bedrooms, and clean
the grates; and while her sisters occupied
carpeted chambers hung with
mirrors, where they could see themselves
from head to foot, this poor little
damsel was sent to sleep in an attic,
on an old straw mattress, with only one
chair and not a looking-glass in the
room.</p>

<p>She suffered all in silence, not daring
to complain to her father, who was entirely
ruled by his new wife. When
her daily work was done she used to
sit down in the chimney-corner among
the ashes, from which the two sisters
gave her the nickname of &ldquo;Cinderella.&rdquo;
But Cinderella, however shabbily clad,
was handsomer than they were with all
their fine clothes.</p>

<p>It happened that the king&rsquo;s son gave
a series of balls, to which were invited
all the rank and fashion of the city, and
among the rest the two elder sisters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
They were very proud and happy, and
occupied their whole time in deciding
what they should wear, a source of new
trouble to Cinderella, whose duty it was
to get up their fine linen and laces, and
who never could please them however
much she tried. They talked of nothing
but their clothes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the elder, &ldquo;shall wear my
velvet gown and my trimmings of English
lace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added the younger, &ldquo;will
have but my ordinary silk petticoat,
but I shall adorn it with an upper skirt
of flowered brocade, and shall put on
my diamond tiara, which is a great deal
finer than anything of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the elder sister grew angry, and
dispute began to run so high that Cinderella,
who was known to have excellent
taste, was called upon to decide
between them. She gave them the best
advice she could, and gently and submissively
offered to dress them herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
and especially to arrange their hair,
an accomplishment in which she excelled
many a noted coiffeur. The important
evening came, and she exercised
all her skill to adorn the two young
ladies. While she was combing out the
elder&rsquo;s hair, this ill-natured girl said,
sharply, &ldquo;Cinderella, do you not wish
you were going to the ball?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam&rdquo; (they obliged her always
to say madam), &ldquo;you are only
mocking me; it is not my fortune to
have any such pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; people would only
laugh to see a little cinder-wench at a
ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any other than Cinderella would have
dressed the hair all awry, but she was
good, and dressed it perfectly even and
smooth, and as prettily as she could.</p>

<p>The sisters had scarcely eaten for two
days, and had broken a dozen stay-laces
a day, in trying to make themselves
slender; but to-night they broke a dozen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
more, and lost their tempers over and
over again before they had completed
their toilet. When at last the happy
moment arrived, Cinderella followed
them to the coach; after it had whirled
them away, she sat down by the kitchen
fire and cried.</p>

<p>Immediately her godmother, who was
a fairy, appeared beside her. &ldquo;What
are you crying for, my little maid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;&rdquo; Her sobs
stopped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to go to the ball; isn&rsquo;t it
so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, be a good girl and you
shall go. First run into the garden and
fetch me the largest pumpkin you can
find.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella did not comprehend what
this had to do with her going to the
ball, but, being obedient and obliging,
she went. Her godmother took the
pumpkin, and, having scooped out all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
its inside, struck it with her wand; it
became a splendid gilt coach lined with
rose-colored satin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now fetch me the mouse-trap out
of the pantry, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella brought it; it contained
six of the fattest, sleekest mice. The
fairy lifted up the wire door, and as
each mouse ran out she struck it and
changed it into a beautiful black
horse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what shall I do for your coachman,
Cinderella?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cinderella suggested that she had
seen a large black rat in the rat-trap,
and he might do for want of better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right; go and look again
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was found, and the fairy made him
into a most respectable coachman, with
the finest whiskers imaginable. She afterwards
took six lizards from behind
the pumpkin frame and changed them
into six footmen, all in splendid livery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
who immediately jumped up behind the
carriage, as if they had been footmen
all their days. &ldquo;Well, Cinderella, now
you can go to the ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, in these clothes?&rdquo; said Cinderella
piteously, looking down on her
ragged frock.</p>

<p>Her godmother laughed, and touched
her also with the wand, at which her
wretched, threadbare jacket became stiff
with gold and sparkling with jewels;
her woollen petticoat lengthened into
a gown of sweeping satin, from underneath
which peeped out her little feet,
no longer bare, but covered with silk
stockings and the prettiest glass slippers
in the world. &ldquo;Now, Cinderella,
depart; but remember, if you stay one
instant after midnight, your carriage
will become a pumpkin, your coachman
a rat, your horses mice, and your footmen
lizards; while you yourself will be
the little cinder-wench you were an
hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
Cinderella promised without fear, her
heart was so full of joy.</p>

<p>Arrived at the palace, the king&rsquo;s son,
whom some one, probably the fairy,
had told to await the coming of an uninvited
princess whom nobody knew,
was standing at the entrance ready to
receive her. He offered her his hand,
and led her with the utmost courtesy
through the assembled guests, who
stood aside to let her pass, whispering
to one another, &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful she
is!&rdquo; It might have turned the head of
any one but poor Cinderella, who was
so used to be despised that she took it
all as if it were something happening
in a dream.</p>

<p>Her triumph was complete; even the
old king said to the queen, that never
since her majesty&rsquo;s young days had he
seen so charming and elegant a person.
All the court ladies scanned her eagerly,
clothes and all, determining to have
theirs made next day of exactly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
same pattern. The king&rsquo;s son himself
led her out to dance, and she danced so
gracefully that he admired her more and
more. Indeed, at supper, which was
fortunately early, his admiration quite
took away his appetite. For Cinderella
herself, with an involuntary shyness
she sought out her sisters, placed herself
beside them, and offered them all
sorts of civil attentions, which, coming
as they supposed from a stranger, and
so magnificent a lady, almost overwhelmed
them with delight.</p>

<p>While she was talking with them she
heard the clock strike a quarter to
twelve, and making a courteous adieu
to the royal family, she re-entered her
carriage, escorted tenderly by the king&rsquo;s
son, and arrived in safety at her own
door. There she found her godmother,
who smiled approval, and of whom she
begged permission to go to a second
ball, the following night, to which the
queen had earnestly invited her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
While she was talking the two sisters
were heard knocking at the gate, and
the fairy godmother vanished, leaving
Cinderella sitting in the chimney-corner,
rubbing her eyes and pretending to
be very sleepy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried the eldest sister, maliciously,
&ldquo;it has been the most delightful
ball, and there was present the most
beautiful princess I ever saw, who was
so exceedingly polite to us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was she?&rdquo; said Cinderella, indifferently;
&ldquo;and who might she be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows, though everybody
would give their eyes to know, especially
the king&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; replied Cinderella, a little
more interested. &ldquo;I should like to see
her. Miss Javotte&rdquo;&mdash;that was the elder
sister&rsquo;s name&mdash;&ldquo;will you not let me go
to-morrow, and lend me your yellow
gown that you wear on Sundays?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, lend my yellow gown to a
cinder-wench! I am not so mad as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
that.&rdquo; At which refusal Cinderella did
not complain, for if her sister really had
lent her the gown she would have been
considerably embarrassed.</p>

<p>The next night came, and the two
young ladies, richly dressed in different
toilets, went to the ball. Cinderella,
more splendidly attired and beautiful
than ever, followed them shortly after.
&ldquo;Now remember twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; was
her godmother&rsquo;s parting speech, and she
thought she certainly should. But the
prince&rsquo;s attentions to her were greater
even than the first evening, and, in the
delight of listening to his pleasant conversation,
time slipped by unperceived.
While she was sitting beside him in a
lovely alcove, and looking at the moon
from under a bower of orange blossoms,
she heard a clock strike the first stroke
of twelve. She started up, and fled
away as lightly as a deer.</p>

<p>Amazed, the prince followed, but
could not catch her. Indeed, he missed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
his lovely princess altogether, and only
saw running out of the palace doors a
little dirty lass whom he had never beheld
before, and of whom he certainly
would never have taken the least notice.
Cinderella arrived at home breathless
and weary, ragged and cold, without
carriage or footmen or coachman, the
only remnant of her past magnificence
being one of her little glass slippers&mdash;the
other she had dropped in the ballroom
as she ran away.</p>

<p>When the two sisters returned they
were full of this strange adventure: how
the beautiful lady had appeared at the
ball more beautiful than ever, and enchanted
every one who looked at her;
and how as the clock was striking twelve
she had suddenly risen up and fled
through the ballroom, disappearing no
one knew how or where, and dropping
one of her glass slippers behind her in
her flight. How the king&rsquo;s son had remained
inconsolable until he chanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
to pick up the little glass slipper, which
he carried away in his pocket, and was
seen to take it out continually, and
look at it affectionately, with the air of
a man very much in love; in fact, from
his behavior during the remainder of
the evening, all the court and royal
family were convinced that he had
become desperately enamoured of the
wearer of the little glass slipper.</p>

<p>Cinderella listened in silence, turning
her face to the kitchen fire, and perhaps
it was that which made her look so
rosy, but nobody ever noticed or admired
her at home, so it did not signify,
and next morning she went to her
weary work again just as before.</p>

<p>A few days after, the whole city was
attracted by the sight of a herald going
round with a little glass slipper in his
hand, publishing, with a flourish of
trumpets, that the king&rsquo;s son ordered
this to be fitted on the foot of every
lady in the kingdom, and that he wished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
to marry the lady whom it fitted best,
or to whom it and the fellow-slipper belonged.
Princesses, duchesses, countesses,
and simple gentlewomen all tried
it on, but, being a fairy slipper, it fitted
nobody; and, besides, nobody could produce
its fellow-slipper, which lay all the
time safely in the pocket of Cinderella&rsquo;s
old linsey gown.</p>

<p>At last the herald came to the house
of the two sisters, and though they well
knew neither of themselves was the
beautiful lady, they made every attempt
to get their clumsy feet into the
glass slipper, but in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me try it on,&rdquo; said Cinderella,
from the chimney-corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, you?&rdquo; cried the others, bursting
into shouts of laughter; but Cinderella
only smiled and held out her
hand.</p>

<p>Her sisters could not prevent her,
since the command was that every
young maiden in the city should try on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
the slipper, in order that no chance
might be left untried, for the prince
was nearly breaking his heart; and his
father and mother were afraid that,
though a prince, he would actually die
for love of the beautiful unknown lady.</p>

<p>So the herald bade Cinderella sit
down on a three-legged stool in the
kitchen, and himself put the slipper on
her pretty little foot, which it fitted
exactly. She then drew from her pocket
the fellow-slipper, which she also put
on, and stood up&mdash;for with the touch
of the magic shoes all her dress was
changed likewise&mdash;no longer the poor,
despised cinder-wench, but the beautiful
lady whom the king&rsquo;s son loved.</p>

<p>Her sisters recognized her at once.
Filled with astonishment, mingled with
no little alarm, they threw themselves
at her feet, begging her pardon for all
their former unkindness. She raised
and embraced them, told them she forgave
them with all her heart, and only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
hoped they would love her always.
Then she departed with the herald to
the king&rsquo;s palace, and told her whole
story to his majesty and the royal
family, who were not in the least surprised,
for everybody believed in fairies,
and everybody longed to have a fairy
godmother.</p>

<p class="caption">The slipper fitted exactly</p>

<p>For the young prince, he found her
more lovely and lovable than ever, and
insisted upon marrying her immediately.
Cinderella never went home again,
but she sent for her two sisters to the
palace, and with the consent of all
parties married them shortly after to
two rich gentlemen of the court.</p>

<h2>JACK AND THE BEAN-STALK</h2>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the days of King Alfred there
lived a poor woman whose cottage
was in a remote country village many
miles from London. She had been a
widow some years, and had an only
child named Jack, whom she indulged
so much that he never paid the least
attention to anything she said, but was
indolent, careless, and extravagant. His
follies were not owing to a bad disposition,
but to his mother&rsquo;s foolish partiality.
By degrees he spent all that
she had&mdash;scarcely anything remained
but a cow.</p>

<p>One day, for the first time in her life,
she reproached him: &ldquo;Cruel, cruel boy!
you have at last brought me to beggary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
I have not money enough to purchase
even a bit of bread; nothing now remains
to sell but my poor cow! I am
sorry to part with her; it grieves me
sadly, but we cannot starve.&rdquo; For a
few minutes Jack felt remorse, but it
was soon over; and he began asking his
mother to let him sell the cow at the
next village, teasing her so much that
she at last consented.</p>

<p>As he was going along he met a
butcher, who inquired why he was
driving the cow from home? Jack
replied he was going to sell it. The
butcher held some curious beans in his
hat; they were of various colors and
attracted Jack&rsquo;s attention. This did not
pass unnoticed by the man, who, knowing
Jack&rsquo;s easy temper, thought now
was the time to take an advantage of
it, and, determined not to let slip so
good an opportunity, asked what was
the price of the cow, offering at the
same time all the beans in his hat for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
her. The silly boy could not conceal
the pleasure he felt at what he supposed
so great an offer; the bargain was struck
instantly, and the cow exchanged for
a few paltry beans. Jack made the
best of his way home, calling aloud to
his mother before he reached the door,
thinking to surprise her.</p>

<p>When she saw the beans and heard
Jack&rsquo;s account, her patience quite forsook
her; she tossed the beans out of
the window, where they fell on the
garden-bed below. Then she threw her
apron over her head and cried bitterly.
Jack attempted to console her, but in
vain, and, not having anything to eat,
they both went supperless to bed.
Jack awoke early in the morning, and,
seeing something uncommon darkening
the window of his bedchamber, ran
down-stairs into the garden, where he
found some of the beans had taken root
and sprung up surprisingly; the stalks
were of an immense thickness, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
twined together until they formed a
ladder like a chain, and so high that
the top appeared to be lost in the
clouds. Jack was an adventurous lad;
he determined to climb up to the top,
and ran to tell his mother, not doubting
but that she would be as much
pleased as he was. She declared he
should not go, said it would break her
heart if he did&mdash;entreated and threatened,
but all in vain. Jack set out, and
after climbing for some hours reached
the top of the bean-stalk quite exhausted.
Looking around, he found himself
in a strange country; it appeared to be
a barren desert&mdash;not a tree, shrub,
house, or living creature was to be seen;
here and there were scattered fragments
of stone; and at unequal distances small
heaps of earth were loosely thrown together.</p>

<p>Jack seated himself pensively upon
a block of stone and thought of his
mother; he reflected with sorrow upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
his disobedience in climbing the bean-stalk
against her will, and concluded
that he must die of hunger. However,
he walked on, hoping to see a house
where he might beg something to eat
and drink. He did not find it; but he
saw at a distance a beautiful lady, walking
all alone. She was elegantly clad
and carried a white wand, at the top
of which sat a peacock of pure gold.</p>

<p>Jack, who was a gallant fellow, went
straight up to her, when, with a bewitching
smile, she asked him how he
came there. He told her all about the
bean-stalk. The lady answered him by
a question, &ldquo;Do you remember your
father, young man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam; but I am sure there is
some mystery about him, for when I
name him to my mother she always
begins to weep, and will tell me nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She dare not,&rdquo; replied the lady,
&ldquo;but I can and will. For know, young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
man, that I am a fairy and was your
father&rsquo;s guardian. But fairies are bound
by laws as well as mortals, and by an
error of mine I lost my power for a term
of years, so that I was unable to succour
your father when he most needed
it, and he died.&rdquo; Here the fairy looked
so sorrowful that Jack&rsquo;s heart warmed
to her, and he begged her earnestly to
tell him more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will; only you must promise to
obey me in everything, or you will perish
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack was brave, and, besides, his fortunes
were so bad they could not well be
worse, so he promised.</p>

<p>The fairy continued: &ldquo;Your father,
Jack, was a most excellent, amiable,
generous man. He had a good wife,
faithful servants, plenty of money; but
he had one misfortune&mdash;a false friend.
This was a giant, whom he had succoured
in misfortune, and who returned
his kindness by murdering him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
seizing on all his property; also making
your mother take a solemn oath that
she would never tell you anything about
your father, or he would murder both
her and you. Then he turned her off
with you in her arms, to wander about
the wide world as she might. I could
not help her, as my power only returned
on the day you went to sell your cow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; added the fairy, &ldquo;who
impelled you to take the beans, who
made the bean-stalk grow, and inspired
you with the desire to climb up
it to this strange country; for it is here
the wicked giant lives who was your
father&rsquo;s destroyer. It is you who must
avenge him, and rid the world of a
monster who never will do anything
but evil. I will assist you. You may
lawfully take possession of his house
and all his riches, for everything he has
belonged to your father, and is therefore
yours. Now farewell! Do not let
your mother know you are acquainted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
with your father&rsquo;s history. This is my
command, and if you disobey me you
will suffer for it. Now go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jack asked where he was to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Along the direct road till you see
the house where the giant lives. You
must then act according to your own
just judgment, and I will guide you if
any difficulty arises. Farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bestowed on the youth a benignant
smile, and vanished.</p>

<p>Jack pursued his journey. He walked
on till after sunset, when to his great
joy, he espied a large mansion. A plain-looking
woman was at the door; he accosted
her, begging she would give him
a morsel of bread and a night&rsquo;s lodging.
She expressed the greatest surprise,
and said it was quite uncommon to see
a human being near their house; for it
was well known that her husband was
a powerful giant, who would never eat
anything but human flesh, if he could
possibly get it; that he would walk fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
miles to procure it, usually being out
the whole day for that purpose.</p>

<p>This account greatly terrified Jack,
but still he hoped to elude the giant,
and therefore he again entreated the
woman to take him in for one night
only, and hide him where she thought
proper. She at last suffered herself to
be persuaded, for she was of a compassionate
and generous disposition, and
took him into the house. First they
entered a fine large hall magnificently
furnished; they then passed through
several spacious rooms in the same
style of grandeur; but all appeared forsaken
and desolate. A long gallery
came next; it was very dark&mdash;just light
enough to show that, instead of a wall
on one side, there was a grating of iron
which parted off a dismal dungeon,
from whence issued the groans of those
victims whom the cruel giant reserved
in confinement for his own voracious
appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
Poor Jack was half dead with fear,
and would have given the world to
have been with his mother again, for
he now began to doubt if he should ever
see her more; he even mistrusted the
good woman, and thought she had let
him into the house for no other purpose
than to lock him up among the unfortunate
people in the dungeon. However,
she bade Jack sit down, and gave
him plenty to eat and drink; and he,
not seeing anything to make him uncomfortable,
soon forgot his fear and
was just beginning to enjoy himself,
when he was startled by a loud knocking
at the outer door, which made the
whole house shake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the giant; and if he sees
you he will kill you and me, too,&rdquo; cried
the poor woman, trembling all over.
&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hide me in the oven,&rdquo; cried Jack,
now as bold as a lion at the thought of
being face to face with his father&rsquo;s cruel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
murderer. So he crept into the oven&mdash;for
there was no fire near it&mdash;and listened
to the giant&rsquo;s loud voice and
heavy step as he went up and down the
kitchen scolding his wife. At last he
seated himself at table, and Jack, peeping
through a crevice in the oven, was
amazed to see what a quantity of food
he devoured. It seemed as if he never
would have done eating and drinking;
but he did at last, and, leaning back,
called to his wife in a voice like thunder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring me my hen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed, and placed upon the
table a very beautiful live hen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay!&rdquo; roared the giant, and the hen
laid immediately an egg of solid gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay another!&rdquo; and every time the
giant said this the hen laid a larger egg
than before.</p>

<p>He amused himself a long time with
his hen, and then sent his wife to bed,
while he fell asleep by the fireside and
snored like the roaring of cannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
As soon as he was asleep Jack crept
out of the oven, seized the hen, and ran
off with her. He got safely out of the
house, and, finding his way along the
road he came, reached the top of the
bean-stalk, which he descended in
safety.</p>

<p>His mother was overjoyed to see him.
She thought he had come to some ill
end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it, mother. Look
here!&rdquo; and he showed her the hen.
&ldquo;Now lay,&rdquo; and the hen obeyed him as
readily as the giant, and laid as many
golden eggs as he desired.</p>

<p>These eggs being sold, Jack and his
mother got plenty of money, and for
some months lived very happily together,
till Jack got another great longing
to climb the bean-stalk and carry
away some more of the giant&rsquo;s riches.
He had told his mother of his adventure,
but had been very careful not
to say a word about his father. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
thought of his journey again and again,
but still he could not summon resolution
enough to break it to his mother,
being well assured that she would endeavor
to prevent his going. However,
one day he told her boldly that
he must take another journey up the
bean-stalk. She begged and prayed him
not to think of it, and tried all in her
power to dissuade him; she told him
that the giant&rsquo;s wife would certainly
know him again, and that the giant
would desire nothing better than to
get him into his power, that he might
put him to a cruel death, in order to be
revenged for the loss of his hen. Jack,
finding that all his arguments were useless,
ceased speaking, though resolved
to go at all events. He had a dress
prepared which would disguise him,
and something to color his skin; he
thought it impossible for any one to
recollect him in this dress.</p>

<p>A few mornings after he rose very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
early, and, unperceived by any one,
climbed the bean-stalk a second time.
He was greatly fatigued when he reached
the top, and very hungry. Having rested
some time on one of the stones, he
pursued his journey to the giant&rsquo;s mansion,
which he reached late in the evening.
The woman was at the door as
before. Jack addressed her, at the
same time telling her a pitiful tale, and
requesting that she would give him
some victuals and drink, and also a
night&rsquo;s lodging.</p>

<p>She told him (what he knew before
very well) about her husband&rsquo;s being a
powerful and cruel giant, and also that
she had one night admitted a poor,
hungry, friendless boy; that the little
ungrateful fellow had stolen one of the
giant&rsquo;s treasures, and ever since that
her husband had been worse than before,
using her very cruelly, and continually
upbraiding her with being the
cause of his misfortune. Jack felt sorry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
for her, but confessed nothing, and did
his best to persuade her to admit him,
but found it a very hard task. At last
she consented, and as she led the way,
Jack observed that everything was just
as he had found it before. She took him
into the kitchen, and after he had done
eating and drinking, she hid him in an
old lumber-closet. The giant returned
at the usual time, and walked in so
heavily that the house was shaken to
its foundation. He seated himself by
the fire, and soon after exclaimed,
&ldquo;Wife, I smell fresh meat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife replied it was the crows
which had brought a piece of raw meat
and left it at the top of the house.
While supper was preparing, the giant
was very ill-tempered and impatient,
frequently lifting up his hand to strike
his wife for not being quick enough.
He was also continually upbraiding her
with the loss of his wonderful hen.</p>

<p>At last, having ended his supper, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
cried, &ldquo;Give me something to amuse
me&mdash;my harp or my money-bags.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which will you have, my dear?&rdquo; said
the wife, humbly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My money-bags, because they are
the heaviest to carry,&rdquo; thundered he.</p>

<p>She brought them, staggering under
the weight&mdash;two bags, one filled with
new guineas and the other with new
shillings. She emptied them out on the
table, and the giant began counting them
in great glee. &ldquo;Now you may go to bed,
you old fool.&rdquo; So the wife crept away.</p>

<p>Jack from his hiding-place watched
the counting of the money, which he
knew was his poor father&rsquo;s, and wished
it was his own; it would give him much
less trouble than going about selling the
golden eggs. The giant, little thinking
he was so narrowly observed, reckoned
it all up, and then replaced it in the two
bags, which he tied up very carefully
and put beside his chair, with his little
dog to guard them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
At last he fell asleep as before, and
snored so loud that Jack compared
his noise to the roaring of the sea in
a high wind, when the tide is coming
in. At last Jack, concluding all
secure, stole out, in order to carry off
the two bags of money; but just as he
laid his hand upon one of them, the
little dog, which he had not perceived
before, started from under the giant&rsquo;s
chair and barked most furiously. Instead
of endeavoring to escape, Jack
stood still, though expecting his enemy
to awake every instant.</p>

<p>Contrary, however, to his expectation,
the giant continued in a sound
sleep, and Jack, seeing a piece of
meat, threw it to the dog, who at once
ceased barking and began to devour
it. So Jack carried off the bags, one
on each shoulder, but they were so
heavy that it took him two whole days
to descend the bean-stalk and get back
to his mother&rsquo;s door.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Just as he laid his hand upon one of them, the little dog barked
most furiously</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
When he came he found the cottage
deserted. He ran from one room to
another without being able to find any
one; he then hastened into the village,
hoping to see some of the neighbors,
who could inform him where he could
find his mother. An old woman at last
directed him to a neighboring house,
where she was ill of a fever. He was
greatly shocked at finding her apparently
dying, and blamed himself bitterly
as the cause of it all. However, at
sight of her dear son, the poor woman
revived and slowly recovered her health.
Jack gave her his two money-bags.
They had the cottage rebuilt and well
furnished, and lived happier than they
had ever done before.</p>

<p>For three years Jack heard no more
of the bean-stalk, but he could not forget
it, though he feared making his
mother unhappy. It was in vain endeavoring
to amuse himself; he became
thoughtful, and would arise at the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
dawn of day, and sit looking at the
bean-stalk for hours together. His
mother saw that something preyed
upon his mind, and endeavored to discover
the cause; but Jack knew too well
what the consequence would be should
she succeed. He did his utmost, therefore,
to conquer the great desire he had
for another journey up the bean-stalk.
Finding, however, that his inclination
grew too powerful for him, he began to
make secret preparations for his journey.
He prepared a new disguise,
better and more complete than the
former, and when summer came, on the
longest day he awoke as soon as it was
light, and, without telling his mother,
ascended the bean-stalk. He found the
road, journey, etc., much as it was on
the two former times. He arrived at
the giant&rsquo;s mansion in the evening, and
found the wife standing, as usual, at the
door. Jack had disguised himself so
completely that she did not appear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
have the least recollection of him; however,
when he pleaded hunger and
poverty, in order to gain admittance,
he found it very difficult indeed to persuade
her. At last he prevailed, and
was concealed in the copper. When the
giant returned he said, furiously, &ldquo;I
smell fresh meat!&rdquo; But Jack felt quite
composed, since the giant had said this
before and had been soon satisfied.
However, the giant started up suddenly,
and, notwithstanding all his wife
could say, he searched all round the
room. While this was going forward
Jack was exceedingly terrified, wishing
himself at home a thousand times; but
when the giant approached the copper
and put his hand upon the lid, Jack
thought his death was certain.</p>

<p>But nothing happened; for the giant
did not take the trouble to lift up the
lid, but sat down shortly by the fireside
and began to eat his enormous
supper. When he had finished he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
commanded his wife to fetch down
his harp. Jack peeped under the
copper-lid and saw a most beautiful
harp. The giant placed it on the
table, said &ldquo;Play!&rdquo; and it played of
its own accord, without anybody touching
it, the most exquisite music imaginable.
Jack, who was a very good
musician, was delighted, and more
anxious to get this than any other of
his enemy&rsquo;s treasures. But the giant
not being particularly fond of music,
the harp had only the effect of lulling
him to sleep earlier than usual. As
for the wife, she had gone to bed as soon
as ever she could.</p>

<p>As soon as he thought all was safe,
Jack got out of the copper, and, seizing
the harp, was eagerly running off with
it. But the harp was enchanted by a
fairy, and as soon as it found itself in
strange hands it called out loudly, just
as if it had been alive, &ldquo;Master! Master!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
The giant awoke, started up, and saw
Jack scampering away as fast as his
legs could carry him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you villain! it is you who have
robbed me of my hen and my money-bags,
and now you are stealing my harp
also. Wait till I catch you and I&rsquo;ll eat
you up alive!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well: try!&rdquo; shouted Jack, who
was not a bit afraid, for he saw the
giant was so tipsy he could hardly
stand, much less run; and he himself
had young legs and a clear conscience,
which carry a man a long way. So,
after leading the giant a considerable
race, he contrived to be first at the top
of the bean-stalk, and then scrambled
down it as fast as he could, the harp
playing all the while the most melancholy
music till he said &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; and
it stopped.</p>

<p>Arrived at the bottom, he found his
mother sitting at her cottage door
weeping silently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here, mother, don&rsquo;t cry; just give
me a hatchet&mdash;make haste.&rdquo; For he
knew there was not a moment to spare;
he saw the giant beginning to descend
the bean-stalk.</p>

<p>But the monster was too late&mdash;his
ill deeds had come to an end. Jack
with his hatchet cut the bean-stalk
close off at the root. The giant fell
headlong into the garden, and was killed
on the spot.</p>

<p>Instantly the fairy appeared and explained
everything to Jack&rsquo;s mother,
begging her to forgive Jack, who was
his father&rsquo;s own son for bravery and
generosity, and who would be sure to
make her happy for the rest of her
days.</p>

<p>So all ended well, and nothing was
ever more heard or seen of the wonderful
bean-stalk.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE there was a royal couple who
grieved excessively because they
had no children. When at last, after
long waiting, the queen presented her
husband with a little daughter, his
majesty showed his joy by giving a
christening feast so grand that the like
of it was never known. He invited all
the fairies in the land&mdash;there were seven
altogether&mdash;to stand godmothers to the
little princess, hoping that each might
bestow on her some good gift, as was
the custom of good fairies in those
days.</p>

<p>After the ceremony all the guests
returned to the palace, where there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
set before each fairy-godmother a magnificent
covered dish, with an embroidered
table-napkin, and a knife and fork
of pure gold studded with diamonds
and rubies. But alas! as they placed
themselves at table there entered an
old fairy who had never been invited,
because more than fifty years since she
had left the king&rsquo;s dominion on a tour
of pleasure and had not been heard of
until this day. His majesty, much
troubled, desired a cover to be placed
for her, but it was of common delf, for
he had ordered from his jeweller only
seven gold dishes for the seven fairies
aforesaid. The elderly fairy thought
herself neglected, and muttered angry
menaces, which were overheard by one
of the younger fairies, who chanced to
sit beside her. This good godmother,
afraid of harm to the pretty baby, hastened
to hide herself behind the tapestry
in the hall. She did this because she
wished all the others to speak first&mdash;so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
that if any ill gift were bestowed on
the child she might be able to counteract
it.</p>

<p>The six now offered their good wishes&mdash;which,
unlike most wishes, were sure
to come true. The fortunate little princess
was to grow up the fairest woman
in the world; to have a temper sweet
as an angel; to be perfectly graceful
and gracious; to sing like a nightingale;
to dance like a leaf on a tree; and to
possess every accomplishment under
the sun. Then the old fairy&rsquo;s turn
came. Shaking her head spitefully,
she uttered the wish that when the
baby grew up into a young lady, and
learned to spin, she might prick her
finger with the spindle and die of the
wound.</p>

<p>At this terrible prophecy all the
guests shuddered, and some of the
more tender-hearted began to weep.
The lately happy parents were almost
out of their wits with grief. Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
which the wise young fairy appeared
from behind the tapestry, saying cheerfully;
&ldquo;Your majesties may comfort
yourselves; the princess shall not die. I
have no power to alter the ill-fortune
just wished her by my ancient sister&mdash;her
finger must be pierced, and she
shall then sink, not into the sleep of
death, but into a sleep that will last a
hundred years. After that time is ended
the son of a king will find her,
awaken her, and marry her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately all the fairies vanished.</p>

<p>The king, in the hope of avoiding his
daughter&rsquo;s doom, issued an edict forbidding
all persons to spin, and even to
have spinning-wheels in their houses,
on pain of instant death. But it was
in vain. One day, when she was just
fifteen years of age, the king and queen
left their daughter alone in one of their
castles, when, wandering about at her
will, she came to an ancient dungeon
tower, climbed to the top of it, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
found a very old woman&mdash;so old and
deaf that she had never heard of the
king&rsquo;s edict&mdash;busy with her wheel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing, good old woman?&rdquo;
said the princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m spinning, my pretty child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, how charming! Let me try
if I can spin also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had no sooner taken up the spindle
than, being lively and obstinate,
she handled it so awkwardly and carelessly
that the point pierced her finger.
Though it was so small a wound, she
fainted away at once, and dropped
silently down on the floor. The poor,
frightened old woman called for help;
shortly came the ladies in waiting, who
tried every means to restore their young
mistress, but all their care was useless.
She lay, beautiful as an angel, the color
still lingering in her lips and cheeks;
her fair bosom softly stirred with her
breath; only her eyes were fast closed.
When the king, her father, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
queen, her mother, beheld her thus,
they knew regret was idle&mdash;all had happened
as the cruel fairy meant. But
they also knew that their daughter
would not sleep forever, though after
one hundred years it was not likely they
would either of them behold her awakening.
Until that happy hour should
arrive, they determined to leave her in
repose. They sent away all the physicians
and attendants, and themselves
sorrowfully laid her upon a bed of
embroidery, in the most elegant apartment
of the palace. There she slept
and looked like a sleeping angel still.</p>

<p>When this misfortune happened, the
kindly young fairy who had saved the
princess by changing her sleep of death
into this sleep of a hundred years was
twelve thousand leagues away in the
kingdom of Mataquin. But being informed
of everything, she arrived speedily
in a chariot of fire drawn by dragons.
The king was somewhat startled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
by the sight, but nevertheless went to
the door of his palace, and, with a mournful
countenance, presented her his hand
to descend.</p>

<p>The fairy condoled with his majesty,
and approved of all he had done. Then,
being a fairy of great common-sense
and foresight, she suggested that the
princess, awakening after a hundred
years in this ancient castle, might be a
good deal embarrassed, especially with
a young prince by her side, to find herself
alone. Accordingly, without asking
any one&rsquo;s leave, she touched with
her magic wand the entire population
of the palace, except the king and
queen&mdash;governesses, ladies of honor,
waiting-maids, gentlemen ushers, cooks,
kitchen-girls, pages, footmen, down to
the horses that were in the stables and
the grooms that attended them&mdash;she
touched each and all. Nay, with kind
consideration for the feelings of the
princess, she even touched the little fat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
lapdog Puffy, who had laid himself
down beside his mistress on her splendid
bed. He, like all the rest, fell fast
asleep in a moment. The very spits
that were before the kitchen fire ceased
turning, and the fire itself went out, and
everything became as silent as if it were
the middle of the night, or as if the
palace were a palace of the dead.</p>

<p>The king and queen&mdash;having kissed
their daughter and wept over her a little,
but not much, she looked so sweet
and content&mdash;departed from the castle,
giving orders that it was to be approached
no more. The command was
unnecessary; for in one quarter of an
hour there sprung up around it a wood
so thick and thorny that neither beasts
nor men could attempt to penetrate
there. Above this dense mass of forest
could only be perceived the top of the
high tower where the lovely princess
slept.</p>

<p>A great many changes happen in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
hundred years. The king, who never
had a second child, died, and his throne
passed into another royal family. So
entirely was the story of the poor princess
forgotten, that when the reigning
king&rsquo;s son, being one day out hunting
and stopped in the chase by this formidable
wood, inquired what wood it
was, and what were those towers which
he saw appearing out of the midst of
it, no one could answer him. At length
an old peasant was found who remembered
having heard his grandfather say
to his father, that in this tower was a
princess, beautiful as the day, who was
doomed to sleep there for one hundred
years, until awakened by a king&rsquo;s son,
her destined bridegroom.</p>

<p>At this the young prince, who had
the spirit of a hero, determined to find
out the truth for himself. Spurred on
by both generosity and curiosity, he
leaped from his horse and began to
force his way through the thick wood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
To his amazement the stiff branches
all gave way, and the ugly thorns
sheathed themselves of their own accord,
and the brambles buried themselves
in the earth to let him pass.
This done, they closed behind him,
allowing none of his suite to follow:
but, ardent and young, he went boldly
on alone. The first thing he saw was
enough to smite him with fear. Bodies
of men and horses lay extended on the
ground; but the men had faces, not
death-white, but red as peonies, and
beside them were glasses half filled with
wine, showing that they had gone to
sleep drinking. Next he entered a
large court paved with marble, where
stood rows of guards presenting arms,
but motionless as if cut out of stone;
then he passed through many chambers
where gentlemen and ladies, all in the
costume of the past century, slept at
their ease, some standing, some sitting.
The pages were lurking in corners, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
ladies of honor were stooping over their
embroidery frames, or listening apparently
with polite attention to the gentlemen
of the court, but all were as silent
as statues and as immovable. Their
clothes, strange to say, were fresh and
new as ever; and not a particle of dust
or spider-web had gathered over the
furniture, though it had not known a
broom for a hundred years. Finally
the astonished prince came to an inner
chamber, where was the fairest sight
his eyes had ever beheld.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">A young girl of wonderful beauty lay asleep on an embroidered bed</p>

<p>A young girl of wonderful beauty lay
asleep on an embroidered bed, and she
looked as if she had only just closed
her eyes. Trembling, the prince approached
and knelt beside her. Some
say he kissed her, but as nobody saw it,
and she never told, we cannot be quite
sure of the fact. However, as the end
of the enchantment had come, the princess
awakened at once, and, looking at
him with eyes of the tenderest regard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
said, drowsily: &ldquo;Is it you, my prince?
I have waited for you very long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Charmed with these words, and still
more with the tone in which they were
uttered, the prince assured her that he
loved her more than his life. Nevertheless,
he was the most embarrassed of
the two; for, thanks to the kind fairy,
the princess had plenty of time to dream
of him during her century of slumber,
while he had never even heard of her
till an hour before. For a long time did
they sit conversing, and yet had not
said half enough. Their only interruption
was the little dog Puffy, who
had awakened with his mistress, and
now began to be exceedingly jealous
that the princess did not notice him as
much as she was wont to do.</p>

<p>Meantime all the attendants, whose
enchantment was also broken, not being
in love, were ready to die of hunger
after their fast of a hundred years. A
lady of honor ventured to intimate that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
dinner was served; whereupon the prince
handed his beloved princess at once to
the great hall. She did not wait to
dress for dinner, being already perfectly
and magnificently attired, though in a
fashion somewhat out of date. However,
her lover had the politeness not
to notice this, nor to remind her that
she was dressed exactly like her royal
grandmother, whose portrait still hung
on the palace walls.</p>

<p>During the banquet a concert took
place by the attendant musicians, and
considering they had not touched their
instruments for a century, they played
extremely well. They ended with a
wedding march; for that very evening
the marriage of the prince and princess
was celebrated, and though the bride
was nearly one hundred years older
than the bridegroom, it is remarkable
that the fact would never had been discovered
by any one unacquainted therewith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
After a few days they went together
out of the castle and enchanted wood,
both of which immediately vanished,
and were never more beheld by mortal
eyes. The princess was restored to her
ancestral kingdom, but it was not generally
declared who she was, as during
a hundred years people had grown so
very much cleverer that nobody then
living would ever have believed the
story. So nothing was explained, and
nobody presumed to ask any questions
about her, for ought not a prince be
able to marry whomsoever he pleases?</p>

<p>Nor&mdash;whether or not the day of
fairies was over&mdash;did the princess ever
see anything further of her seven godmothers.
She lived a long and happy
life, like any other ordinary woman,
and died at length, beloved, regretted,
but, the prince being already no more,
perfectly contented.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE there was a little village maiden,
the prettiest ever seen. Her
mother was foolishly fond of her, and
her grandmother likewise. The old
woman made for her a little hood,
which became the damsel so well that
ever after she went by the name of
Little Red-Riding-Hood. One day,
when her mother was making cakes,
she said, &ldquo;My child, you shall go and
see your grandmother, for I hear she
is not well; and you shall take her some
of these cakes and a pot of butter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Red-Riding-Hood was delighted
to go, though it was a long walk;
but she was a good child, and fond of
her kind grandmother. Passing through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
a wood, she met a great wolf, who was
most eager to eat her up, but dared
not, because of a woodcutter who was
busy hard by. So he only came and
asked her politely where she was going.
The poor child, who did not know how
dangerous it is to stop and speak to
wolves, replied, &ldquo;I am going to see my
grandmother, and to take her a cake
and a pot of butter, which my mother
has sent her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it very far from hence?&rdquo; asked
the wolf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; it is just above the mill
which you may see up there&mdash;the first
house you come to in the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the wolf, &ldquo;I will go
there also, to inquire after your excellent
grandmother; I will go one way,
and you the other, and we will see who
can be there first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he ran as fast as ever he could,
taking the shortest road, but the little
maiden took the longest; for she stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
to pluck roses in the wood, to chase butterflies,
and gather nosegays of the
prettiest flowers she could find&mdash;she
was such a happy and innocent little
soul.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">He asked her politely where she was going</p>

<p>The wolf was not long in reaching the
grandmother&rsquo;s door. He knocked, Toc&mdash;toc,
and the grandmother said, &ldquo;Who
is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is your child, Little Red-Riding-Hood,&rdquo;
replied the wicked beast, imitating
the girl&rsquo;s voice; &ldquo;I bring you a
cake and a pot of butter, which my
mother has sent you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grandmother, who was ill in her
bed, said, &ldquo;Very well, my dear, pull
the string and the latch will open.&rdquo;
The wolf pulled the string&mdash;the door
flew open; he leaped in, fell upon the
poor old woman, and ate her up in less
than no time, tough as she was, for he
had not tasted anything for more than
three days. Then he carefully shut the
door, and laying himself down snugly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
in the bed, waited for Little Red-Riding-Hood,
who was not long before
she came and knocked, Toc&mdash;toc, at the
door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; said the wolf; and
the little maiden, hearing his gruff voice,
felt sure that her poor grandmother
must have caught a bad cold and be
very ill indeed.</p>

<p>So she answered, cheerfully, &ldquo;It is
your child, Little Red-Riding-Hood,
who brings you a cake and a pot of butter
that my mother has sent you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the wolf, softening his voice as
much as he could, said, &ldquo;Pull the string,
and the latch will open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Little Red-Riding-Hood pulled the
string and the door opened. The wolf,
seeing her enter, hid himself as much
as he could under the coverlid of the
bed, and said in a whisper, &ldquo;Put the
cake and the pot of butter on the shelf,
and then make haste and come to bed,
for it is very late.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
Little Red-Riding-Hood did not think
so; but, to please her grandmother, she
undressed herself and began to get ready
for bed, when she was very much astonished
to find how different the old
woman looked from ordinary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, what great arms you
have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to hug you the better, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, what great ears you
have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to hear you the better, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, what great eyes you
have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to see you the better, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmother, what a great mouth
you have!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is to eat you up!&rdquo; cried the
wicked wolf; and immediately he fell
upon poor Little Red-Riding-Hood, and
ate her up in a moment.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE country was lovely just then;
it was summer! The wheat was
golden and the oats still green; the hay
was stacked in the rich, low-lying meadows,
where the stork was marching
about on his long red legs, chattering
Egyptian, the language his mother had
taught him.</p>

<p>Round about field and meadow lay
great woods, in the midst of which
were deep lakes. Yes, the country
certainly was delicious. In the sunniest
spot stood an old mansion surrounded
by a deep moat, and great
dock leaves grew from the walls of the
house right down to the water&rsquo;s edge,
some of them were so tall that a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
child could stand upright under them.
In among the leaves it was as secluded
as in the depths of a forest, and there
a duck was sitting on her nest. Her
little ducklings were just about to be
hatched, but she was nearly tired of
sitting, for it had lasted such a long
time. Moreover, she had very few
visitors, as the other ducks liked swimming
about in the moat better than
waddling up to sit under the dock
leaves and gossip with her.</p>

<p>At last one egg after another began
to crack. &ldquo;Cheep, cheep!&rdquo; they said.
All the chicks had come to life, and
were poking their heads out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quack! quack!&rdquo; said the duck; and
then they all quacked their hardest,
and looked about them on all sides
among the green leaves; their mother
allowed them to look as much as they
liked, for green is good for the eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How big the world is to be sure!&rdquo;
said all the young ones; for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
certainly had ever so much more room to
move about than when they were inside
the egg-shell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you imagine this is the whole
world?&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;It stretches
a long way on the other side of the
garden, right into the parson&rsquo;s field;
but I have never been as far as that!
I suppose you are all here now?&rdquo; and
she got up. &ldquo;No! I declare I have not
got you all yet! The biggest egg is still
there; how long is it going to last?&rdquo;
and then she settled herself on the nest
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how are you getting on?&rdquo;
said an old duck who had come to pay
her a visit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This one egg is taking such a long
time,&rdquo; answered the sitting duck, &ldquo;the
shell will not crack; but now you must
look at the others; they are the finest
ducklings I have ever seen! they are all
exactly like their father, the rascal! he
never comes to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me look at the egg which won&rsquo;t
crack,&rdquo; said the old duck. &ldquo;You may
be sure that it is a turkey&rsquo;s egg! I
have been cheated like that once, and
I had no end of trouble and worry with
the creatures, for I may tell you that
they are afraid of the water. I could
not get them into it; I quacked and
snapped at them, but it was no good.
Let me see the egg! Yes, it is a turkey&rsquo;s
egg! You just leave it alone and
teach the other children to swim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will sit on it a little longer; I have
sat so long already that I may as well
go on till the Midsummer Fair comes
round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please yourself,&rdquo; said the old duck,
and she went away.</p>

<p>At last the big egg cracked. &ldquo;Cheep,
cheep!&rdquo; said the young one and tumbled
out; how big and ugly he was!
The duck looked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a monstrous big duckling,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;none of the others looked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
that; can he be a turkey chick? well,
we shall soon find that out; into the
water he shall go, if I have to kick him
in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next day was gloriously fine, and the
sun shone on all the green dock leaves.
The mother duck with her whole family
went down to the moat.</p>

<p>Splash, into the water she sprang.
&ldquo;Quack, quack!&rdquo; she said, and one
duckling plumped in after the other.
The water dashed over their heads, but
they came up again and floated beautifully;
their legs went of themselves,
and they were all there, even the big
ugly gray one swam about with them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that is no turkey,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;see how beautifully he uses his legs
and how erect he holds himself; he is
my own chick! after all, he is not so
bad when you come to look at him
properly. Quack, quack! Now come
with me and I will take you into the
world, and introduce you to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
duckyard; but keep close to me all the time,
so that no one may tread upon you,
and beware of the cat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they went into the duckyard.
There was a fearful uproar going on,
for two broods were fighting for the
head of an eel, and in the end the cat
captured it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how things go in this world,&rdquo;
said the mother duck; and she licked
her bill, for she wanted the eel&rsquo;s head
for herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Use your legs,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;mind you
quack properly, and bend your necks to
the old duck over there! She is the
grandest of them all; she has Spanish
blood in her veins and that accounts
for her size, and, do you see? she has a
red rag round her leg; that is a wonderfully
fine thing, and the most extraordinary
mark of distinction any duck
can have. It shows clearly that she is
not to be parted with, and that she is
worthy of recognition both by beasts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
and men! Quack now! don&rsquo;t turn your
toes in, a well brought up duckling keeps
his legs wide apart just like father and
mother; that&rsquo;s it, now bend your necks,
and say quack!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They did as they were bid, but the
other ducks round about looked at
them and said, quite loud: &ldquo;Just look
there! now we are to have that tribe!
just as if there were not enough of us
already, and, oh dear! how ugly that
duckling is, we won&rsquo;t stand him!&rdquo; and
a duck flew at him at once and bit him
in the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him be,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;he
is doing no harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very likely not, but he is so ungainly
and queer,&rdquo; said the biter, &ldquo;he must
be whacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are handsome children mother
has,&rdquo; said the old duck with the rag round
her leg; &ldquo;all good looking except this
one, and he is not a good specimen; it&rsquo;s
a pity you can&rsquo;t make him over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
&ldquo;That can&rsquo;t be done, your grace,&rdquo; said
the mother duck; &ldquo;he is not handsome,
but he is a thorough good creature,
and he swims as beautifully as any of
the others; nay, I think I might venture
even to add that I think he will improve
as he goes on, or perhaps in time
he may grow smaller! he was too long
in the egg, and so he has not come out
with a very good figure.&rdquo; And then
she patted his neck and stroked him
down. &ldquo;Besides, he is a drake,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;so it does not matter so much.
I believe he will be very strong, and I
don&rsquo;t doubt but he will make his way
in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other ducklings are very pretty,&rdquo;
said the old duck. &ldquo;Now make yourselves
quite at home, and if you find the
head of an eel you may bring it to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After that they felt quite at home.
But the poor duckling which had been
the last to come out of the shell, and
who was so ugly, was bitten, pushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
about, and made fun of both by the
ducks and the hens. &ldquo;He is too big,&rdquo;
they all said; and the turkey-cock, who
was born with his spurs on, and therefore
thought himself quite an emperor,
puffed himself up like a vessel in full
sail, made for him, and gobbled and
gobbled till he became quite red in the
face. The poor duckling was at his
wit&rsquo;s end, and did not know which way
to turn; he was in despair because he
was so ugly and the butt of the whole
duckyard.</p>

<p>So the first day passed, and afterwards
matters grew worse and worse. The
poor duckling was chased and hustled
by all of them; even his brothers and
sisters ill-used him, and they were always
saying, &ldquo;If only the cat would
get hold of you, you hideous object!&rdquo;
Even his mother said, &ldquo;I wish to goodness
you were miles away.&rdquo; The ducks
bit him, the hens pecked him, and the
girl who fed them kicked him aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
Then he ran off and flew right over
the hedge, where the little birds flew
up into the air in a fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is because I am so ugly,&rdquo;
thought the poor duckling, shutting his
eyes, but he ran on all the same. Then
he came to a great marsh where the
wild ducks lived; he was so tired and
miserable that he stayed there the
whole night.</p>

<p>In the morning the wild ducks flew
up to inspect their new comrade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What sort of a creature are you?&rdquo;
they inquired, as the duckling turned
from side to side and greeted them as
well as he could. &ldquo;You are frightfully
ugly,&rdquo; said the wild ducks; &ldquo;but that
does not matter to us, so long as you
do not marry into our family!&rdquo; Poor
fellow! he had no thought of marriage;
all he wanted was permission to lie
among the rushes, and to drink a little
of the marsh water.</p>

<p>He stayed there two whole days;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
then two wild geese came, or, rather,
two wild ganders; they were not long
out of the shell, and therefore rather
pert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say, comrade,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;you
are so ugly that we have taken quite
a fancy to you; will you join us and be
a bird of passage? There is another
marsh close by, and there are some
charming wild geese there; all sweet
young ladies, who can say quack! You
are ugly enough to make your fortune
among them.&rdquo; Just at that moment,
bang! bang! was heard up above, and
both the wild geese fell dead among the
reeds, and the water turned blood red.
Bang! bang! went the guns, and whole
flocks of wild geese flew up from the
rushes and the shot peppered among
them again.</p>

<p>There was a grand shooting-party,
and the sportsmen lay hidden round the
marsh; some even sat on the branches
of the trees which overhung the water;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
the blue smoke rose like clouds among
the dark trees and swept over the pool.</p>

<p>The water-dogs wandered about in
the swamp&mdash;splash! splash! The rushes
and reeds bent beneath their tread on
all sides. It was terribly alarming to
the poor duckling. He twisted his
head round to get it under his wing,
and just at that moment a frightful
big dog appeared close beside him; his
tongue hung right out of his mouth
and his eyes glared wickedly. He
opened his great chasm of a mouth
close to the duckling, showed his sharp
teeth, and&mdash;splash!&mdash;went on without
touching him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank Heaven!&rdquo; sighed the
duckling, &ldquo;I am so ugly that even the
dog won&rsquo;t bite me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he lay quite still while the shot
whistled among the bushes, and bang
after bang rent the air. It only became
quiet late in the day, but even
then the poor duckling did not dare to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
get up; he waited several hours more
before he looked about, and then he hurried
away from the marsh as fast as
he could. He ran across fields and
meadows, and there was such a wind
that he had hard work to make his way.</p>

<p>Towards night he reached a poor little
cottage; it was such a miserable
hovel that it could not make up its
mind which way to fall even, and so
it remained standing. The wind whistled
so fiercely round the duckling that
he had to sit on his tail to resist it,
and it blew harder and harder; then he
saw that the door had fallen off one
hinge and hung so crookedly that he
could creep into the house through the
crack, and by this means he made his
way into the room. An old woman
lived there with her cat and her hen.
The cat, which she called &ldquo;Sonnie,&rdquo;
could arch his back, purr, and give off
electric sparks&mdash;that is to say, if you
stroked his fur the wrong way. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
hen had quite tiny short legs, and so
she was called &ldquo;Chuckie-low-legs.&rdquo; She
laid good eggs, and the old woman was
as fond of her as if she had been her
own child.</p>

<p>In the morning the strange duckling
was discovered immediately, and the
cat began to purr and the hen to cluck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth is that!&rdquo; said the
old woman, looking round; but her sight
was not good, and she thought the
duckling was a fat duck which had escaped.
&ldquo;This is a capital find,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;now I shall have duck&rsquo;s eggs if
only it is not a drake. We must find
out about that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So she took the duckling on trial for
three weeks, but no eggs made their
appearance. The cat was the master
of the house and the hen the mistress,
and they always spoke of &ldquo;we and the
world,&rdquo; for they thought that they
represented the half of the world, and
that quite the better half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
The duckling thought there might be
two opinions on the subject, but the
cat would not hear of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you lay eggs?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you have the goodness to hold
your tongue, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the cat said, &ldquo;Can you arch
your back, purr, or give off sparks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you had better keep your
opinions to yourself when people of
sense are speaking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The duckling sat in the corner nursing
his ill-humor; then he began to
think of the fresh air and the sunshine,
an uncontrollable longing seized him to
float on the water, and at last he could
not help telling the hen about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What on earth possesses you?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;You have nothing to do; that
is why you get these freaks into your
head. Lay some eggs or take to purring,
and you will get over it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
&ldquo;But it is so delicious to float, on the
water,&rdquo; said the duckling; &ldquo;so delicious
to feel it rushing over your head when
you dive to the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be a fine amusement,&rdquo;
said the hen. &ldquo;I think you have gone
mad. Ask the cat about it, he is the
wisest creature I know; ask him if he
is fond of floating on the water or diving
under it. I say nothing about myself.
Ask our mistress yourself, the
old woman; there is no one in the world
cleverer than she is. Do you suppose
she has any desire to float on the water
or to duck underneath it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand me,&rdquo; said
the duckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if we don&rsquo;t understand you,
who should? I suppose you don&rsquo;t consider
yourself cleverer than the cat or
the old woman, not to mention me.
Don&rsquo;t make a fool of yourself, child,
and thank your stars for all the good
we have done you! Have you not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
lived in this warm room, and in such
society that you might have learned
something? But you are an idiot, and
there is no pleasure in associating with
you. You may believe me I mean you
well, I tell you home truths, and there
is no surer way than that of knowing
who are one&rsquo;s friends. You just see
about laying some eggs, or learn to purr,
or to emit sparks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I will go out into the wide
world,&rdquo; said the duckling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, do so by all means!&rdquo; said the
hen.</p>

<p>So away went the duckling; he floated
on the water and ducked underneath it,
but he was looked askance at by every
living creature for his ugliness. Now
the autumn came on, the leaves in the
woods turned yellow and brown; the
wind took hold of them, and they
danced about. The sky looked very
cold, and the clouds hung heavy with
snow and hail. A raven stood on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
fence and croaked Caw! Caw! from sheer
cold; it made one shiver only to think
of it. The poor duckling certainly was
in a bad case.</p>

<p>One evening the sun was just setting
in wintry splendor when a flock of beautiful
large birds appeared out of the
bushes. The duckling had never seen
anything so beautiful. They were dazzlingly
white with long waving necks;
they were swans; and, uttering a peculiar
cry, they spread out their magnificent
broad wings, and flew away from the
cold regions to warmer lands and open
seas. They mounted so high, so very
high, and the ugly little duckling became
strangely uneasy; he circled round
and round in the water like a wheel,
craning his neck up into the air after
them. Then he uttered a shriek so
piercing and so strange that he was
quite frightened by it himself. Oh, he
could not forget those beautiful birds,
those happy birds! And as soon as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
were out of sight he ducked right down
to the bottom, and when he came up
again he was quite beside himself. He
did not know what the birds were or
whither they flew, but all the same he
was more drawn towards them than he
had ever been by any creatures before.
He did not even envy them in the least.
How could it occur to him even to wish
to be such a marvel of beauty; he would
have been thankful if only the ducks
would have tolerated him among them&mdash;the
poor ugly creature!</p>

<p>The winter was so bitterly cold that
the duckling was obliged to swim about
in the water to keep it from freezing,
but every night the hole in which he
swam got smaller and smaller. Then
it froze so hard that the surface ice
cracked, and the duckling had to use
his legs all the time, so that the ice
should not close in round him; at last
he was so weary that he could move no
more, and he was frozen fast into the ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
Early in the morning a peasant came
along and saw him; he went out onto
the ice and hammered a hole in it with
his heavy wooden shoe, and carried the
duckling home to his wife. There it
soon revived. The children wanted to
play with it, but the duckling thought
they were going to ill-use him, and
rushed in his fright into the milk pan,
and the milk spurted out all over the
room. The woman shrieked and threw
up her hands; then it flew into the butter
cask, and down into the meal tub
and out again. Just imagine what it
looked like by this time! The woman
screamed and tried to hit it with the
tongs, and the children tumbled over
one another in trying to catch it, and
they screamed with laughter. By good
luck the door stood open, and the duckling
flew out among the bushes and
the new fallen snow, and it lay there
thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<p>But it would be too sad to mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
all the privation and misery it had to
go through during that hard winter.
When the sun began to shine warmly
again the duckling was in the marsh,
lying among the rushes; the larks were
singing, and the beautiful spring had
come.</p>

<p>Then all at once it raised its wings,
and they flapped with much greater
strength than before and bore him off
vigorously. Before he knew where he
was he found himself in a large garden
where the apple-trees were in a full
blossom, and the air was scented with
lilacs, the long branches of which overhung
the indented shores of the lake.
Oh! the spring freshness was so delicious!</p>

<p>Just in front of him he saw three
beautiful white swans advancing towards
him from a thicket; with rustling
feathers they swam lightly over the
water. The duckling recognized the
majestic birds, and he was overcome
by a strange melancholy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will fly to them, the royal birds,
and they will hack me to pieces, because
I, who am so ugly, venture to
approach them! But it won&rsquo;t matter;
better be killed by them than be snapped
at by the ducks, pecked by the hens,
or spurned by the henwife, or suffer so
much misery in the winter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he flew into the water, and swam
towards the stately swans; they saw
him, and darted towards him with
ruffled feathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kill me, oh, kill me!&rdquo; said the poor
creature, and bowing his head towards
the water he awaited his death. But
what did he see reflected in the transparent
water?</p>

<p>He saw below him his own image;
but he was no longer a clumsy, dark,
gray bird, ugly and ungainly. He was
himself a swan! It does not matter in
the least having been born in a duckyard
if only you come out of a swan&rsquo;s
egg!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
He felt quite glad of all the misery
and tribulation he had gone through;
he was the better able to appreciate
his good-fortune now, and all the beauty
which greeted him. The big swans
swam round and round him, and stroked
him with their bills.</p>

<p>Some little children came into the
garden with corn and pieces of bread,
which they threw into the water; and
the smallest one cried out: &ldquo;There is
a new one!&rdquo; The other children shouted
with joy: &ldquo;Yes, a new one has come!&rdquo;
And they clapped their hands and
danced about, running after their father
and mother. They threw the bread
into the water, and one and all said
that &ldquo;the new one was the prettiest;
he was so young and handsome.&rdquo; And
the old swans bent their heads and did
homage before him.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Some little children threw pieces of bread into the water</p>

<p>He felt quite shy, and hid his head
under his wing; he did not know what
to think; he was so very happy, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
not at all proud; a good heart never
becomes proud. He thought of how
he had been pursued and scorned, and
now he heard them all say that he was
the most beautiful of all beautiful birds.
The lilacs bent their boughs right down
into the water before him, and the
bright sun was warm and cheering,
and he rustled his feathers and raised
his slender neck aloft, saying, with exultation
in his heart: &ldquo;I never dreamed
of so much happiness when I was the
Ugly Duckling!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE once lived in a village a
fagot-maker and his wife who had
seven children&mdash;all boys; the eldest
was no more than ten years old, and
the youngest was only seven. It was
odd enough, to be sure, that they should
have so many children in such a short
time; but the truth is, the wife always
brought him two and once three at a
time. This made him very poor, for
not one of these boys was old enough to
get a living; and what was still worse,
the youngest was a puny little fellow
who hardly ever spoke a word. Now
this, indeed, was a mark of his good
sense, but it made his father and mother
suppose him to be silly, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
thought that at last he would turn out
quite a fool. This boy was the least
size ever seen; for when he was born
he was no bigger than a man&rsquo;s thumb,
which made him be christened by the
name of Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb. The poor
child was the drudge of the whole house,
and always bore the blame of everything
that was done wrong. For all
this, Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb was far more
clever than any of his brothers; and
though he spoke but little he heard
and knew more than people thought.
It happened just at this time that for
want of rain the fields had grown but
half as much corn and potatoes as they
used to grow; so that the fagot-maker
and his wife could not give the boys
the food they had before, which was
always either bread or potatoes.</p>

<p>After the father and mother had
grieved some time, they thought that
as they could contrive no other way to
live they must somehow get rid of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
children. One night when the boys
were gone to bed, and the fagot-maker
and his wife were sitting over a few
lighted sticks, to warm themselves, the
husband sighed deeply, and said: &ldquo;You
see, my dear, we cannot maintain our
children any longer, and to see them
die of hunger before my eyes is what I
could never bear. I will, therefore, to-morrow
morning take them to the
forest, and leave them in the thickest
part of it, so that they will not be able
to find their way back: this will be very
easy; for while they amuse themselves
with tying up the fagots, we need only
slip away when they are looking some
other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, husband!&rdquo; cried the poor wife,
&ldquo;you cannot, no, you never can consent
to be the death of your own children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The husband in vain told her to
think how very poor they were.</p>

<p>The wife replied &ldquo;that this was true,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
to be sure; but if she was poor, she was
still their mother&rdquo;; and then she cried
as if her heart would break. At last
she thought how shocking it would be
to see them starved to death before their
eyes, so she agreed to what her husband
had said, and then went sobbing to bed.</p>

<p>Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb had been awake all
the time; and when he heard his father
talk very seriously, he slipped away
from his brothers&rsquo; side, and crept under
his father&rsquo;s bed, to hear all that
was said without being seen.</p>

<p>When his father and mother had left
off talking, he got back to his own place,
and passed the night in thinking what
he should do the next morning.</p>

<p>He rose early, and ran to the river&rsquo;s
side, where he filled his pockets with
small white pebbles, and then went
back home. In the morning they all
set out, as their father and mother had
agreed on; and Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb did
not say a word to any of his brothers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
about what he had heard. They came
to a forest that was so very thick that
they could not see each other a few
yards off. The fagot-maker set to
work cutting down wood; and the children
began to gather the twigs, to make
fagots of them.</p>

<p>When the father and mother saw that
the young ones were all very busy, they
slipped away without being seen. The
children soon found themselves alone,
and began to cry as loud as they could.
Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb let them cry on, for
he knew well enough how to lead them
safe home, as he had taken care to drop
the white pebbles he had in his pocket
along all the way he had come. He
only said to them, &ldquo;Never mind it, my
lads; father and mother have left us
here by ourselves, but only take care
to follow me, and I will lead you back
again.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">The children began to cry as loud as they could</p>

<p>When they heard this they left off
crying, and followed Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
who soon brought them to their father&rsquo;s
house by the very same path which they
had come along. At first they had not
the courage to go in, but stood at the
door to hear what their parents were
talking about. Just as the fagot-maker
and his wife had come home without
their children a great gentleman
of the village sent to pay them two
guineas for work they had done for
him, which he had owed them so long
that they never thought of getting a
farthing of it. This money made them
quite happy; for the poor creatures
were very hungry, and had no other
way of getting anything to eat.</p>

<p>The fagot-maker sent his wife out
immediately to buy some meat; and as
it was a long time since she had made
a hearty meal, she bought as much
meat as would have been enough for
six or eight persons. The truth was,
when she was thinking what would be
enough for dinner, she forgot that her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
children were not at home; but as soon
as she and her husband had done eating,
she cried out: &ldquo;Alas! where are our
poor children? How they would feast
on what we have left! It was all your
fault, husband! I told you we should
repent leaving them to starve in the
forest! Oh, mercy! perhaps they have
already been eaten by the hungry
wolves!&rdquo; The poor woman shed plenty
of tears. &ldquo;Alas! alas!&rdquo; said she, over
and over again, &ldquo;what is become of
my dear children?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children, who were all at the
door, cried out together, &ldquo;Here we are,
mother, here we are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flew like lightning to let them in,
and kissed every one of them.</p>

<p>The fagot-maker and his wife were
charmed at having their children once
more with them, and their joy for this
lasted till their money was all spent;
but then they found themselves quite
as ill off as before. So by degrees they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
again thought of leaving them in the
forest: and that the young ones might
not come back a second time, they said
they would take them a great deal
farther than they did at first. They
could not talk about this matter so slyly
but that Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb found
means to hear all that passed between
them; but he cared very little about it,
for he thought it would be easy for him
to do just the same as he had done before.
But although he got up very
early the next morning to go to the
river&rsquo;s side to get the pebbles, a thing
which he had not thought of hindered
him; for he found that the house door
was double locked. Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
was now quite at a loss what to do; but
soon after this his mother gave each
of the children a piece of bread for
breakfast and then it came into his
head that he could make his share do
as well as the pebbles by dropping
crumbs of it all the way as he went.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
So he did not eat his piece, but put it
into his pocket.</p>

<p>It was not long before they all set
out, and their parents took care to lead
them into the very thickest and darkest
part of the forest. They then slipped
away by a by-path as before, and left
the children by themselves again. All
this did not give Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
any concern, for he thought himself
quite sure of getting back by means of
the crumbs that he had dropped by
the way; but when he came to look for
them he found that not a crumb was
left, for the birds had eaten them all up.</p>

<p>The poor children were now sadly off,
for the farther they went the harder it
was for them to get out of the forest.
At last night came on, and the noise of
the wind among the trees seemed to
them like the howling of wolves, so that
every moment they thought they should
be eaten up. They hardly dared to
speak a word, or to move a limb, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
fear. Soon after there came a heavy
rain which wetted them to the very
skin, and made the ground so slippery
that they fell down at almost every
step and got dirty all over.</p>

<p>Before it was quite dark Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
climbed up to the top of a
tree, and looked round on all sides to
see if he could find any way of getting
help. He saw a small light, like that
of a candle, but it was a very great
way off, and beyond the forest. He
then came down from the tree, to try
to find the way to it; but he could not
see it when he was on the ground, and
he was in the utmost trouble what to
do next. They walked on towards the
place where he had seen the light, and
at last reached the end of the forest,
and got sight of it again. They now
walked faster; and after being much
tired and vexed (for every time they
got into lower ground they lost sight
of the light), came to the house it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
in. They knocked at the door, which
was opened by a very poor-natured-looking
lady, who asked what brought
them there. Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb told her
that they were poor children who had
lost their way in the forest, and begged
that she would give them a bed till
morning. When the lady saw that they
had such pretty faces she began to
shed tears, and said: &ldquo;Ah, my poor children,
you do not know what place you
are come to. This is the house of an
Ogre, who eats up little boys and
girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; replied Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb,
who trembled from head to foot,
&ldquo;what shall we do? If we go back to
the forest we are sure of being torn to
pieces by the wolves; we would rather,
therefore, be eaten by the gentleman.
Besides, when he sees us, perhaps he
may take pity on us and spare our
lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogre&rsquo;s wife thought she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
contrive to hide them from her husband
till morning; so she let them go in and
warm themselves by a good fire, before
which there was a whole sheep
roasting for the Ogre&rsquo;s supper. When
they had stood a short time by the fire
there came a loud knocking at the door:
this was the Ogre come home. His
wife hurried the children under the bed
and told them to lie still, and she then
let her husband in.</p>

<p>The Ogre asked if supper were ready,
and if the wine were fetched from the
cellar; and then he sat down at the table.
The sheep was not quite done, but he
liked it much better half raw. In a
minute or two the Ogre began to snuff
to his right and left, and said he smelt
child&rsquo;s flesh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be this calf, which has just
been killed,&rdquo; said his wife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I smell child&rsquo;s flesh, I tell thee once
more!&rdquo; cried the Ogre, looking all about
the room&mdash;&ldquo;I smell child&rsquo;s flesh; there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
is something going on that I do not
know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as he had spoken these words
he rose from his chair and went towards
the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you thought
to cheat me, did you? Wretch! thou
art old and tough thyself, or else I would
eat thee up too! But come, come, this
is lucky enough; for the brats will make
a nice dish for three Ogres, who are my
particular friends, and who are to dine
with me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then drew them out one by one
from under the bed. The poor children
fell on their knees and begged his pardon
as humbly as they could; but this
Ogre was the most cruel of all Ogres,
and instead of feeling any pity, he only
began to think how sweet and tender
their flesh would be; so he told his wife
they would be nice morsels if she served
them up with plenty of sauce. He then
fetched a large knife, and began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
sharpen it on a long whetstone that he
held in his left hand; and all the while
he came nearer and nearer to the bed.
The Ogre took up one of the children,
and was going to set about cutting him
to pieces; but his wife said to him:
&ldquo;What in the world makes you take
the trouble of killing them to-night?
Will it not be time enough to-morrow
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your prating,&rdquo; replied the
Ogre; &ldquo;they will grow tender by being
kept a little while after they are killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said this wife, &ldquo;you have got
so much meat in the house already;
here is a calf, two sheep, and half a pig.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the Ogre, &ldquo;so give them
all a good supper, that they may not
get lean, and then send them to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good creature was quite glad at
this. She gave them plenty for their
supper, but the poor children were so
terrified that they could not eat a bit.</p>

<p>The Ogre sat down to his wine, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
much pleased with the thought of giving
his friends such a dainty dish: this
made him drink rather more than common,
and he was soon obliged to go to
bed himself. Now the Ogre had seven
daughters, who were all very young like
Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb and his brothers.
These young Ogresses had fair skins,
because they fed on raw meat like their
father; but they had small gray eyes,
quite round, and sunk in their heads,
hooked noses, wide mouths, and very
long, sharp teeth, standing a great way
off each other. They were too young
as yet to do much mischief; but they
showed that if they lived to be as old
as their father they would grow quite
as cruel as he was, for they took pleasure
already in biting young children
and sucking their blood. The Ogresses
had been put to bed very early that
night; they were all in one bed, which
was very large, and every one of them
had a crown of gold on her head. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
was another bed of the same size in the
room, and in this the Ogre&rsquo;s wife put
the seven little boys, and then went to
bed herself along with her husband.</p>

<p>Now Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb was afraid
that the Ogre would wake in the night,
and kill him and his brothers while they
were asleep. So he got out of bed in
the middle of the night as softly as he
could, took off all his brothers&rsquo; nightcaps
and his own, and crept with them
to the bed that the Ogre&rsquo;s daughters
were in; he then took off their crowns,
and put the nightcaps on their heads
instead; next he put the crowns on his
brothers&rsquo; heads and his own, and got
into bed again; expecting, after this,
that, if the Ogre should come, he would
take him and his brothers for his own
children. Everything turned out as
he wished. The Ogre waked soon after
midnight, and began to be very sorry
that he had put off killing the boys till
the morning; so he jumped out of bed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
and took hold of his large knife. &ldquo;Let
us see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what the young
rogues are about, and do the business
at once!&rdquo; He then walked softly to
the room where they all slept, and went
up to the bed the boys were in, who
were all asleep except Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb.
He touched their heads one
at a time, and feeling the crowns of
gold, said to himself: &ldquo;Oh, oh! I had
like to have made such a mistake! I
must have drunk too much wine last
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went next to the bed that his own
little Ogresses were in, and when he felt
the nightcaps, he said, &ldquo;Ah! here you
are, my lads&rdquo;; and so in a moment he
cut the throats of all his daughters.</p>

<p>He was very much pleased when he
had done this, and then went back to
his own bed. As soon as Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
heard him snore he awoke his
brothers, and told them to put on their
clothes quickly, and follow him. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
stole down softly into the garden, and
then jumped from the wall into the
road; they ran as fast as their legs
could carry them, but were so much
afraid all the while that they hardly
knew which way to take. When the
Ogre waked in the morning he said to
his wife, grinning: &ldquo;My dear, go and
dress the young rogues I saw last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wife was quite surprised at hearing
her husband speak so kindly, and
did not dream of the real meaning of
his words. She supposed he wanted
her to help them to put on their clothes;
so she went up-stairs, and the first thing
she saw was her seven daughters with
their throats cut and all over blood.
This threw her into a fainting fit. The
Ogre was afraid his wife might be too
long in doing what he had set her about,
so he went himself to help her; but he
was as much shocked as she had been
at the dreadful sight of his bleeding
children. &ldquo;Ah! what have I done?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
he cried. &ldquo;But the little rascals shall
pay for it, I warrant them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He first threw some water on his
wife&rsquo;s face; and, as soon as she came
to herself, he said to her: &ldquo;Bring me
quickly my seven-league boots, that I
may go and catch the little vipers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Ogre then put on these boots,
and set out with all speed. He strided
over many parts of the country, and
at last turned into the very road in
which the poor children were. For they
had set off towards the fagot-maker&rsquo;s
cottage, which they had almost reached.
They watched the Ogre stepping from
mountain to mountain at one step, and
crossing rivers as if they had been tiny
brooks. At this Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
thought a little what was to be done;
and spying a hollow place under a large
rock, he made his brothers get into it.
He then crept in himself, but kept his
eye fixed on the Ogre, to see what he
would do next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
The Ogre found himself quite weary
with the journey he had gone, for seven-league
boots are very tiresome to the
person who wears them; so he now began
to think of resting, and happened
to sit down on the very rock where the
poor children were hid. As he was so
tired, and it was a hot day, he fell fast
asleep, and soon began to snore so loud
that the little fellows were terrified.</p>

<p>When Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb saw this he
said to his brothers, &ldquo;Courage, my lads!
never fear! you have nothing to do but
to steal away and get home while the
Ogre is fast asleep, and leave me to
shift for myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers now were very glad to
do whatever he told them, and so they
soon came to their father&rsquo;s house. In
the mean time Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb went
up to the Ogre softly, pulled off his
seven-league boots very gently, and
put them on his own legs; for though
the boots were very large, yet being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
fairy-boots, they could make themselves
small enough to fit any leg they
pleased.</p>

<p>As soon as ever Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
had made sure of the Ogre&rsquo;s seven-league
boots, he went at once to the
palace, and offered his services to carry
orders from the King to his army, which
was a great way off, and to bring back
the quickest accounts of the battle they
were just at that time fighting with the
enemy. In short, he thought he could
be of more use to the King than all his
mail-coaches, and so should make his
fortune in this manner. He succeeded
so well that in a short time he made
money enough to keep himself, his
father, mother, and six brothers, without
the trouble of working, for the rest
of their lives. Having done this, he
went back to his father&rsquo;s cottage, where
all the family were delighted to see him
again. As the great fame of his boots
had been talked of at court in this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
the King sent for him, and indeed employed
him very often in the greatest
affairs of the state, so that he became
one of the richest men in the kingdom.</p>

<p>And now let us see what became of
the wicked Ogre. He slept so soundly
that he never discovered the loss of his
boots; but having an evil conscience
and bad dreams, he fell in his sleep from
the corner of the rock where Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
and his brothers had left
him, and bruised himself so much from
head to foot that he could not stir;
so he was forced to stretch himself out
at full length, and wait for some one
to come and help him.</p>

<p>Now a good many fagot-makers
passed near the place where the Ogre
lay, and when they heard him groan
they went up to ask him what was the
matter. But the Ogre had eaten such
a great number of children in his lifetime
that he had grown so very big
and fat that these men could not even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
have carried one of his legs, so they
were forced to leave him there. At
last night came on, and then a large
serpent came out of a wood just by
and stung him, so that he died in great
pain.</p>

<p>By and by, Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb, who
had become the King&rsquo;s first favorite,
heard of the Ogre&rsquo;s death; and the first
thing he did was to tell his Majesty all
that the good-natured Ogress had done
to save the lives of himself and brothers.
The King was so much pleased at what
he heard that he asked Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
if there was any favor he could
bestow upon her. Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb
thanked the King, and desired that the
Ogress might have the noble title of
Duchess of Draggletail given to her,
which was no sooner asked than granted.
The Ogress then came to court, and
lived very happily for many years, enjoying
the vast fortune she had found
in the Ogre&rsquo;s chests. As for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
Hop-o&rsquo;-my-Thumb, he every day grew more
witty and brave; till at last the King
made him the greatest lord in the kingdom,
and set him over all his affairs.</p>

<h2>BEAUTY AND THE BEAST</h2>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a very rich merchant
who had six children&mdash;three
boys and three girls. As he was himself
a man of great sense, he spared no
expense for their education. The three
daughters were all handsome, but particularly
the youngest; indeed, she was
so very beautiful that in her childhood
every one called her the Little Beauty;
and being equally lovely when she was
grown up, nobody called her by any
other name, which made her sisters very
jealous of her. This youngest daughter
was not only more handsome than her
sisters, but also was better tempered.
The two eldest were vain of their wealth
and position. They gave themselves a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
thousand airs, and refused to visit other
merchants&rsquo; daughters; nor would they
condescend to be seen except with persons
of quality. They went every day
to balls, plays, and public walks, and
always made game of their youngest
sister for spending her time in reading
or other useful employments. As it
was well known that these young ladies
would have large fortunes, many great
merchants wished to get them for wives;
but the two eldest always answered
that, for their parts, they had no
thoughts of marrying any one below a
duke or an earl at least. Beauty had
quite as many offers as her sisters, but
she always answered, with the greatest
civility, that though she was much
obliged to her lovers, she would rather
live some years longer with her father,
as she thought herself too young to
marry.</p>

<p>It happened that, by some unlucky
accident, the merchant suddenly lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
all his fortune, and had nothing left
but a small cottage in the country.
Upon this he said to his daughters, while
the tears ran down his cheeks, &ldquo;My
children, we must now go and dwell in
the cottage, and try to get a living by
labor, for we have no other means of
support.&rdquo; The two eldest replied that
they did not know how to work, and
would not leave town; for they had lovers
enough who would be glad to marry
them, though they had no longer any
fortune. But in this they were mistaken;
for when the lovers heard what
had happened, they said, &ldquo;The girls
were so proud and ill-tempered that
all we wanted was their fortune; we are
not sorry at all to see their pride brought
down; let them show off their airs to
their cows and sheep.&rdquo; But everybody
pitied poor Beauty, because she was so
sweet-tempered and kind to all, and
several gentlemen offered to marry her,
though she had not a penny; but Beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
still refused, and said she could not
think of leaving her poor father in his
trouble. At first Beauty could not
help sometimes crying in secret for the
hardships she was now obliged to suffer;
but in a very short time she said to herself,
&ldquo;All the crying in the world will
do me no good, so I will try to be
happy without a fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When they had removed to their cottage
the merchant and his three sons
employed themselves in ploughing and
sowing the fields, and working in the
garden. Beauty also did her part, for
she rose by four o&rsquo;clock every morning,
lighted the fires, cleaned the house, and
got ready the breakfast for the whole
family. At first she found all this very
hard; but she soon grew quite used to
it, and thought it no hardship; indeed,
the work greatly benefited her health.
When she had done she used to amuse
herself with reading, playing her music,
or singing while she spun. But her two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
sisters were at a loss what to do to pass
the time away: they had their breakfast
in bed, and did not rise till ten
o&rsquo;clock. Then they commonly walked
out, but always found themselves very
soon tired, when they would often sit
down under a shady tree, and grieve for
the loss of their carriage and fine clothes,
and say to each other, &ldquo;What a mean-spirited,
poor, stupid creature our young
sister is, to be so content with this low
way of life!&rdquo; But their father thought
differently, and loved and admired his
youngest child more than ever.</p>

<p>After they had lived in this manner
about a year the merchant received a
letter, which informed him that one of
his richest ships, which he thought was
lost, had just come into port. This
news made the two eldest sisters almost
mad with joy, for they thought they
should now leave the cottage, and have
all their finery again. When they
found that their father must take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
journey to the ship, the two eldest
begged he would not fail to bring them
back some new gowns, caps, rings, and
all sorts of trinkets. But Beauty asked
for nothing; for she thought in herself
that all the ship was worth would hardly
buy everything her sisters wished for.
&ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;how
comes it that you ask for nothing?
What can I bring you, my child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are so kind as to think of
me, dear father,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I
should be glad if you would bring me a
rose, for we have none in our garden.&rdquo;
Now Beauty did not indeed wish for a
rose, nor anything else, but she only
said this that she might not affront her
sisters; otherwise they would have said
she wanted her father to praise her for
desiring nothing. The merchant took
his leave of them, and set out on his
journey; but when he got to the ship
some persons went to law with him
about the cargo, and after a deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
trouble he came back to his cottage as
poor as he had left it. When he was
within thirty miles of his home, and
thinking of the joy of again meeting his
children, he lost his way in the midst
of a dense forest. It rained and snowed
very hard, and, besides, the wind was
so high as to throw him twice from his
horse. Night came on, and he feared
he should die of cold and hunger, or be
torn to pieces by the wolves that he
heard howling round him. All at once
he cast his eyes towards a long avenue,
and saw at the end a light, but it seemed
a great way off. He made the best of
his way towards it, and found that it
came from a splendid palace, the windows
of which were all blazing with
light. It had great bronze gates, standing
wide open, and fine court-yards,
through which the merchant passed;
but not a living soul was to be seen.
There were stables too, which his poor,
starved horse, less scrupulous than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
himself, entered at once, and took a good
meal of oats and hay. His master then
tied him up, and walked towards the
entrance-hall, but still without seeing a
single creature. He went on to a large
dining-parlor, where he found a good
fire, and a table covered with some very
nice dishes, but only one plate with a
knife and fork. As the snow and rain
had wetted him to the skin, he went up
to the fire to dry himself. &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;the master of the house or
his servants will excuse me, for it surely
will not be long now before I see
them.&rdquo; He waited some time, but
still nobody came; at last the clock
struck eleven, and the merchant, being
quite faint for the want of food, helped
himself to a chicken, and to a few glasses
of wine, yet all the time trembling with
fear. He sat till the clock struck twelve,
and then, taking courage, began to
think he might as well look about him;
so he opened a door at the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
hall, and went through it into a very
grand room, in which there was a fine
bed; and as he was feeling very weary,
he shut the door, took off his clothes,
and got into it.</p>

<p>It was ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning before
he awoke, when he was amazed to
see a handsome new suit of clothes laid
ready for him, instead of his own, which
were all torn and spoiled. &ldquo;To be
sure,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;this place
belongs to some good fairy, who has
taken pity on my ill luck.&rdquo; He looked
out of the window, and instead of the
snow-covered wood, where he had lost
himself the previous night, he saw the
most charming arbors covered with all
kinds of flowers. Returning to the
hall where he had supped, he found a
breakfast-table, ready prepared. &ldquo;Indeed,
my good fairy,&rdquo; said the merchant
aloud, &ldquo;I am vastly obliged to you for
your kind care of me.&rdquo; He then made
a hearty breakfast, took his hat, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
was going to the stable to pay his horse
a visit; but as he passed under one of
the arbors, which was loaded with roses,
he thought of what Beauty had asked
him to bring back to her, and so he took
a bunch of roses to carry home. At
the same moment he heard a loud noise,
and saw coming towards him a beast,
so frightful to look at that he was ready
to faint with fear. &ldquo;Ungrateful man!&rdquo;
said the beast, in a terrible voice, &ldquo;I
have saved your life by admitting you
into my palace, and in return you steal
my roses, which I value more than anything
I possess. But you shall atone
for your fault: you shall die in a quarter
of an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant fell on his knees, and,
clasping his hands, said, &ldquo;Sir, I humbly
beg your pardon. I did not think it
would offend you to gather a rose for
one of my daughters, who had entreated
me to bring her one home. Do not kill
me, my lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am not a lord, but a beast,&rdquo; replied
the monster; &ldquo;I hate false compliments,
so do not fancy that you can
coax me by any such ways. You tell
me that you have daughters; now I
will suffer you to escape if one of them
will come and die in your stead. If not,
promise that you will yourself return
in three months, to be dealt with as I
may choose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tender-hearted merchant had no
thoughts of letting any one of his
daughters die for his sake; but he knew
that if he seemed to accept the beast&rsquo;s
terms, he should at least have the pleasure
of seeing them once again. So he
gave his promise, and was told he might
set off as soon as he liked. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;
said the beast, &ldquo;I do not wish you to
go back empty-handed. Go to the
room you slept in, and you will find a
chest there; fill it with whatsoever you
like best, and I will have it taken to
your own house for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
When the beast had said this he
went away. The good merchant, left
to himself, began to consider that as
he must die&mdash;for he had no thought
of breaking a promise, made even to a
beast&mdash;he might as well have the comfort
of leaving his children provided for.
He returned to the room he had slept
in, and found there heaps of gold pieces
lying about. He filled the chest with
them to the very brim, locked it, and,
mounting his horse, left the palace as
sorrowful as he had been glad when he
first beheld it. The horse took a path
across the forest of his own accord, and
in a few hours they reached the merchant&rsquo;s
house. His children came running
round him, but, instead of kissing
them with joy, he could not help weeping
as he looked at them. He held in
his hand the bunch of roses, which he
gave to Beauty, saying, &ldquo;Take these
roses, Beauty; but little do you think
how dear they have cost your poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
father.&rdquo; And then he gave them an
account of all that he had seen or heard
in the palace of the beast.</p>

<p>The two eldest sisters now began to
shed tears, and to lay the blame upon
Beauty, who, they said, would be the
cause of her father&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;See,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;what happens from the
pride of the little wretch; why did not
she ask for such things as we did? But,
to be sure, miss must not be like other
people; and though she will be the
cause of her father&rsquo;s death, yet she does
not shed a tear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be useless,&rdquo; replied Beauty;
&ldquo;for father shall not die. As the beast
will accept of one of his daughters, I
will give myself up, and be only too
happy to prove my love for the best of
fathers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sister,&rdquo; said the three brothers,
with one voice, &ldquo;that cannot be; we will
go in search of this monster, and either
he or we will perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
&ldquo;Do not hope to kill him,&rdquo; said the
merchant; &ldquo;his power is far too great.
But Beauty&rsquo;s young life shall not be
sacrificed; I am old, and cannot expect
to live much longer; so I shall but give
up a few years of my life, and shall only
grieve for the sake of my children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never, father!&rdquo; cried Beauty; &ldquo;if
you go back to the palace, you cannot
hinder my going after you; though
young, I am not over-fond of life; and
I would much rather be eaten up by
the monster than die of grief for your
loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant in vain tried to reason
with Beauty, who still obstinately kept
to her purpose; which, in truth, made
her two sisters glad, for they were jealous
of her, because everybody loved her.</p>

<p>The merchant was so grieved at the
thoughts of losing his child that he
never once thought of the chest filled
with gold, but at night, to his great surprise,
he found it standing by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
bedside. He said nothing about his riches
to his eldest daughters, for he knew
very well it would at once make them
want to return to town; but he told
Beauty his secret, and she then said
that while he was away two gentlemen
had been on a visit at their cottage who
had fallen in love with her two sisters.
She entreated her father to marry them
without delay, for she was so sweet-natured
she only wished them to be happy.</p>

<p>Three months went by only too fast,
and then the merchant and Beauty got
ready to set out for the palace of the
beast. Upon this the two sisters rubbed
their eyes with an onion to make
believe they were crying; both the merchant
and his sons cried in earnest.
Only Beauty shed no tears. They
reached the palace in a very few hours,
and the horse, without bidding, went
into the same stable as before. The
merchant and Beauty walked towards
the large hall, where they found a table
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
covered with every dainty, and two
plates laid ready. The merchant had
very little appetite; but Beauty, that she
might the better hide her grief, placed
herself at the table, and helped her
father; she then began to eat herself,
and thought all the time that, to be
sure, the beast had a mind to fatten her
before he ate her up, since he had provided
such good cheer for her. When
they had done their supper they heard
a great noise, and the good old man
began to bid his poor child farewell,
for he knew it was the beast coming to
them. When Beauty first saw that
frightful form she was very much terrified,
but tried to hide her fear. The
creature walked up to her and eyed
her all over; then asked her, in a dreadful
voice, if she had come quite of her
own accord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are a good girl, and I am
very much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
This was such an astonishingly civil
answer that Beauty&rsquo;s courage rose; but
it sank again when the beast, addressing
the merchant, desired him to leave the
palace next morning, and never return
to it again. &ldquo;And so good-night, merchant.
And good-night, Beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night, beast,&rdquo; she answered,
as the monster shuffled out of the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! my dear child,&rdquo; said the merchant,
kissing his daughter, &ldquo;I am half
dead already, at the thought of leaving
you with this dreadful beast; you shall
go back and let me stay in your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Beauty, boldly, &ldquo;I will
never agree to that; you must go home
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they wished each other good-night
and went to bed, both of them
thinking they should not be able to
close their eyes; but as soon as ever
they had lain down they fell into a
deep sleep, and did not awake till morning.
Beauty dreamed that a lady came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
up to her, who said: &ldquo;I am very much
pleased, Beauty, with the goodness
you have shown, in being willing to
give your life to save that of your father.
Do not be afraid of anything; you shall
not go without a reward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As soon as Beauty awoke she told her
father this dream; but though it gave
him some comfort, he was a long time
before he could be persuaded to leave
the palace. At last Beauty succeeded
in getting him safely away.</p>

<p>When her father was out of sight
poor Beauty began to weep sorely; still,
having naturally a courageous spirit,
she soon resolved not to make her sad
case still worse by sorrow, which she
knew was vain, but to wait and be
patient. She walked about to take a
view of all the palace, and the elegance
of every part of it much charmed her.</p>

<p>But what was her surprise when she
came to a door on which was written
<span class="smcap">Beauty&rsquo;s Room</span>! She opened it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
haste, and her eyes were dazzled by the
splendor and taste of the apartment.
What made her wonder more than all
the rest was a large library filled with
books, a harpsichord, and many pieces
of music. &ldquo;The beast surely does not
mean to eat me up immediately,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;since he takes care I shall not be
at a loss how to amuse myself.&rdquo; She
opened the library, and saw these verses
written in letters of gold on the back
of one of the books:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Beauteous lady, dry your tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here&rsquo;s no cause for sighs or fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Command as freely as you may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you command and I obey.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said she, sighing, &ldquo;I wish I
could only command a sight of my
poor father, and to know what he is
doing at this moment.&rdquo; Just then, by
chance, she cast her eyes on a looking-glass
that stood near her, and in it she
saw a picture of her old home, and her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
father riding mournfully up to the door.
Her sisters came out to meet him, and
although they tried to look sorry, it
was easy to see that in their hearts they
were very glad. In a short time all
this picture disappeared, but it caused
Beauty to think that the beast, besides
being very powerful, was also very kind.
About the middle of the day she found
a table laid ready for her, and a sweet
concert of music played all the time she
was dining, without her seeing anybody.
But at supper, when she was
going to seat herself at table, she heard
the noise of the beast, and could not
help trembling with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;will you give
me leave to see you sup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is as you please,&rdquo; answered
she, very much afraid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said the beast;
&ldquo;you alone command in this place. If
you should not like my company you
need only say so, and I will leave you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
that moment. But tell me, Beauty,
do you not think me very ugly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;for I cannot
tell a falsehood; but then I think you
are very good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; sadly replied the beast;
&ldquo;yet, besides being ugly, I am also
very stupid: I know well enough that
I am but a beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very stupid people,&rdquo; said Beauty,
&ldquo;are never aware of it themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At which kindly speech the beast
looked pleased, and replied, not without
an awkward sort of politeness, &ldquo;Pray do
not let me detain you from supper, and be
sure that you are well served. All you
see is your own, and I should be deeply
grieved if you wanted for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very kind&mdash;so kind that I
almost forgot you are so ugly,&rdquo; said
Beauty, earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; answered the beast, with
a great sigh; &ldquo;I hope I am good-tempered,
but still I am only a monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
&ldquo;There is many a monster who wears
the form of a man; it is better of the
two to have the heart of a man and the
form of a monster.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would thank you, Beauty, for this
speech, but I am too senseless to say
anything that would please you,&rdquo; returned
the beast, in a melancholy voice;
and altogether he seemed so gentle and
so unhappy that Beauty, who had the
tenderest heart in the world, felt her
fear of him gradually vanish.</p>

<p>She ate her supper with a good appetite,
and conversed in her own sensible and
charming way, till at last, when the beast
rose to depart, he terrified her more than
ever by saying, abruptly, in his gruff
voice, &ldquo;Beauty, will you marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Beauty, frightened as she was,
would speak only the exact truth; besides,
her father had told her that the
beast liked only to have the truth spoken
to him. So she answered, in a very
firm tone, &ldquo;No, beast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
He did not go into a passion, or do
anything but sigh deeply, and depart.</p>

<p>When Beauty found herself alone she
began to feel pity for the poor beast.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;what a sad thing it is
that he should be so very frightful, since
he is so good-tempered!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beauty lived three months in this
palace very well pleased. The beast
came to see her every night, and talked
with her while she supped; and though
what he said was not very clever, yet,
as she saw in him every day some new
goodness, instead of dreading the time
of his coming, she soon began continually
looking at her watch, to see if it were
nine o&rsquo;clock; for that was the hour
when he never failed to visit her. One
thing only vexed her, which was that
every night before he went away he
always made it a rule to ask her if she
would be his wife, and seemed very
much grieved at her steadfastly replying
&ldquo;No.&rdquo; At last, one night, she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
to him, &ldquo;You wound me greatly, beast,
by forcing me to refuse you so often; I
wish I could take such a liking to you
as to agree to marry you, but I must
tell you plainly that I do not think it
will ever happen. I shall always be
your friend, so try to let that content
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must,&rdquo; sighed the beast, &ldquo;for I
know well enough how frightful I am;
but I love you better than myself. Yet
I think I am very lucky in your being
pleased to stay with me; now promise
me, Beauty, that you will never leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beauty would almost have agreed to
this, so sorry was she for him, but she
had that day seen in her magic glass,
which she looked at constantly, that her
father was dying of grief for her sake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I long so much to
see my father that if you do not give
me leave to visit him I shall break my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather break mine, Beauty,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
answered the beast; &ldquo;I will send you to
your father&rsquo;s cottage, you shall stay
there, and your poor beast shall die of
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Beauty, crying, &ldquo;I love
you too well to be the cause of your
death; I promise to return in a week.
You have shown me that my sisters
are married, and my brothers are gone
for soldiers, so that my father is left all
alone. Let me stay a week with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall find yourself with him to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; replied the beast;
&ldquo;but mind, do not forget your promise.
When you wish to return you have
nothing to do but to put your ring on
a table when you go to bed. Good-bye,
Beauty!&rdquo; The beast sighed as he said
these words, and Beauty went to bed
very sorry to see him so much grieved.
When she awoke in the morning she
found herself in her father&rsquo;s cottage.
She rang a bell that was at her bedside,
and a servant entered; but as soon as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
she saw Beauty the woman gave a loud
shriek; upon which the merchant ran
up-stairs, and when he beheld his daughter
he ran to her and kissed her a hundred
times. At last Beauty began to
remember that she had brought no
clothes with her to put on; but the servant
told her she had just found in the
next room a large chest full of dresses,
trimmed all over with gold, and adorned
with pearls and diamonds.</p>

<p>Beauty, in her own mind, thanked
the beast for his kindness, and put on
the plainest gown she could find among
them all. She then desired the servant
to lay the rest aside, for she intended to
give them to her sisters; but, as soon
as she had spoken these words, the chest
was gone out of sight in a moment. Her
father then suggested perhaps the beast
chose for her to keep them all for herself;
and as soon as he had said this,
they saw the chest standing again in
the same place. While Beauty was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
dressing herself a servant brought word
to her that her sisters were come with
their husbands to pay her a visit. They
both lived unhappily with the gentlemen
they had married. The husband
of the eldest was very handsome, but
was so proud of this that he thought of
nothing else from morning till night,
and did not care a pin for the beauty of
his wife. The second had married a
man of great learning; but he made no
use of it, except to torment and affront
all his friends, and his wife more than
any of them. The two sisters were
ready to burst with spite when they saw
Beauty dressed like a princess, and looking
so very charming. All the kindness
that she showed them was of no use;
for they were vexed more than ever
when she told them how happy she
lived at the palace of the beast. The
spiteful creatures went by themselves
into the garden, where they cried to
think of her good-fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why should the little wretch be better
off than we?&rdquo; said they. &ldquo;We are
much handsomer than she is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; said the eldest, &ldquo;a thought
has just come into my head: Let us try
to keep her here longer than the week
for which the beast gave her leave, and
then he will be so angry that perhaps
when she goes back to him he will eat
her up in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is well thought of,&rdquo; answered
the other, &ldquo;but to do this we must pretend
to be very kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They then went to join her in the cottage,
where they showed her so much
false love that Beauty could not help
crying for joy.</p>

<p>When the week was ended the two
sisters began to pretend such grief at
the thought of her leaving them that
she agreed to stay a week more; but
all that time Beauty could not help
fretting for the sorrow that she knew
her absence would give her poor beast;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
for she tenderly loved him, and much
wished for his company again. Among
all the grand and clever people she saw
she found nobody who was half so sensible,
so affectionate, so thoughtful, or
so kind. The tenth night of her being
at the cottage she dreamed she was in
the garden of the palace, that the beast
lay dying on a grass-plot, and with his
last breath put her in mind of her promise,
and laid his death to her forsaking
him. Beauty awoke in a great fright,
and burst into tears. &ldquo;Am not I
wicked,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to behave so ill
to a beast who has shown me so much
kindness? Why will not I marry him?
I am sure I should be more happy with
him than my sisters are with their husbands.
He shall not be wretched any
longer on my account; for I should do
nothing but blame myself all the rest
of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She then rose, put her ring on the
table, got into bed again, and soon fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
asleep. In the morning she with joy
found herself in the palace of the beast.
She dressed herself very carefully, that
she might please him the better, and
thought she had never known a day
pass away so slowly. At last the clock
struck nine, but the beast did not come.
Beauty, dreading lest she might truly
have caused his death, ran from room to
room, calling out, &ldquo;Beast, dear beast!&rdquo;
but there was no answer. At last she
remembered her dream, rushed to the
grass-plot, and there saw him lying apparently
dead beside the fountain. Forgetting
all his ugliness, she threw herself
upon his body, and, finding his
heart still beat, she fetched some water
and sprinkled it over him, weeping and
sobbing the while.</p>

<p>The beast opened his eyes. &ldquo;You forgot
your promise, Beauty, and so I determined
to die; for I could not live
without you. I have starved myself
to death, but I shall die content
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
since I have seen your face once
more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, dear beast,&rdquo; cried Beauty, passionately,
&ldquo;you shall not die; you shall
live to be my husband! I thought it
was only friendship I felt for you, but
now I know it was love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The moment Beauty had spoken these
words the palace was suddenly lighted
up, and all kinds of rejoicings were heard
around them, none of which she noticed,
but hung over her dear beast with the
utmost tenderness. At last, unable to
restrain herself, she dropped her head
over her hands, covered her eyes, and
cried for joy; and, when she looked up
again, the beast was gone. In his stead
she saw at her feet a handsome, graceful
young prince, who thanked her with
the tenderest expressions for having
freed him from enchantment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where is my poor beast? I
only want him and nobody else,&rdquo; sobbed
Beauty.</p>

<p class="caption">She saw at her feet a handsome, graceful young prince</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; replied the prince. &ldquo;A
wicked fairy condemned me to this form,
and forbade me to show that I had any
wit or sense till a beautiful lady should
consent to marry me. You alone, dearest
Beauty, judged me neither by my
looks nor by my talents, but by my
heart alone. Take it, then, and all that
I have besides, for all is yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Beauty, full of surprise, but very
happy, suffered the prince to lead her
to his palace, where she found her father
and sisters, who had been brought there
by the fairy-lady whom she had seen in
a dream the first night she came.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; said the fairy, &ldquo;you have
chosen well, and you have your reward,
for a true heart is better than either
good looks or clever brains. As for
you, ladies,&rdquo; and she turned to the two
elder sisters, &ldquo;I know all your ill deeds,
but I have no worse punishment for you
than to see your sister happy. You
shall stand as statues at the door of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
palace, and when you repent of and
have amended your faults, you shall
become women again. But, to tell you
the truth, I very much fear you will
remain statues forever.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>LITTLE SNOWDROP</h2>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, in the middle of
winter, when the flakes of snow
fell like feathers from the sky, a queen
sat at a window set in an ebony frame,
and sewed. While she was sewing and
watching the snow fall, she pricked her
finger with her needle, and three drops
of blood dropped on the snow. And
because the crimson looked so beautiful
on the white snow, she thought: &ldquo;Oh
that I had a child as white as snow, as
red as blood, and as black as the wood
of this ebony frame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she had a little
daughter, who was as white as snow,
as red as blood, and had hair as black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
as ebony. And when the child was
born the queen died.</p>

<p>After a year had gone by the king
took another wife. She was a handsome
lady, but proud and haughty, and
could not endure that any one should
surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful
mirror, and whenever she walked
up to it, and looked at herself in it, she
said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the mirror replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art the fairest of them all.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And she was satisfied, for she knew
the mirror always told the truth. But
Snowdrop grew ever taller and fairer,
and at seven years old was beautiful
as the day, and more beautiful than the
queen herself. So once, when the queen
asked of her mirror:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>it answered:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, you are grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Snowdrop is fairest of you all.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then the queen was startled, and
turned yellow and green with envy.
From that hour she so hated Snowdrop,
that she burned with secret wrath
whenever she saw the maiden. Pride
and envy grew apace like weeds in her
heart, till she had no rest day or night.
So she called a huntsman and said:
&ldquo;Take the child out in the forest, for
I will endure her no longer in my sight.
Kill her, and bring me her lungs and
liver as tokens that you have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The huntsman obeyed, and led the
child away; but when he had drawn
his hunting-knife, and was about to
pierce Snowdrop&rsquo;s innocent heart, she
began to weep, and said: &ldquo;Ah! dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
huntsman, spare my life, and I will run
deep into the wild forest, and never
more come home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The huntsman took pity on her, because
she looked so lovely, and said,
&ldquo;Run away then, poor child!&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
wild beasts will soon make an end of
thee,&rdquo; he thought.) But it seemed as if
a stone had been rolled from his heart
because he had avoided taking her life;
and as a little bear came by just then,
he killed it, took out its liver and lungs,
and carried them as tokens to the queen.
She made the cook dress them with
salt, and then the wicked woman ate
them, and thought she had eaten Snowdrop&rsquo;s
lungs and liver. The poor child
was now all alone in the great forest,
and she felt frightened as she looked at
all the leafy trees, and knew not what
to do. So she began to run, and ran
over the sharp stones, and through the
thorns; and the wild beasts passed close
to her, but did her no harm. She ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
as long as her feet could carry her, and
when evening closed in, she saw a little
house, and went into it to rest herself.
Everything in the house was very small,
but I cannot tell you how pretty and
clean it was.</p>

<p>There stood a little table, covered
with a white tablecloth, on which were
seven little plates (each little plate with
its own little spoon)&mdash;also seven little
knives and forks, and seven little cups.
Round the walls stood seven little beds
close together, with sheets as white as
snow. Snowdrop being so hungry and
thirsty, ate a little of the vegetables
and bread on each plate, and drank
a drop of wine from every cup, for
she did not like to empty one entirely.</p>

<p>Then, being very tired, she laid herself
down in one of the beds, but could
not make herself comfortable, for one
was too long, and another too short.
The seventh, luckily, was just right; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
there she stayed, said her prayers, and
fell asleep.</p>

<p>When it was grown quite dark, home
came the masters of the house, seven
dwarfs, who delved and mined for iron
among the mountains. They lighted
their seven candles, and as soon as
there was a light in the kitchen, they
saw that some one had been there, for
it was not quite so orderly as they had
left it.</p>

<p>The first said, &ldquo;Who has been sitting
on my stool?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The second, &ldquo;Who has eaten off my
plate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The third, &ldquo;Who has taken part of
my loaf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fourth, &ldquo;Who has touched my
vegetables?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fifth, &ldquo;Who has used my fork?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sixth, &ldquo;Who has cut with my
knife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The seventh, &ldquo;Who has drunk out
of my little cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
Then the first dwarf looked about,
and saw that there was a slight hollow
in his bed, so he asked, &ldquo;Who has been
lying in my little bed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others came running, and each
called out, &ldquo;Some one has also been
lying in my bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the seventh, when he looked in
his bed, saw Snowdrop there, fast
asleep. He called the others, who
flocked round with cries of surprise,
fetched their seven candles, and cast
the light on Snowdrop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Heaven,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;what a
lovely child!&rdquo; and were so pleased that
they would not wake her, but let her
sleep on in the little bed. The seventh
dwarf slept with all his companions in
turn, an hour with each, and so they
spent the night. When it was morning
Snowdrop woke up, and was frightened
when she saw the seven dwarfs. They
were very friendly, however, and inquired
her name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
&ldquo;Snowdrop,&rdquo; answered she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How have you found your way to
our house?&rdquo; further asked the dwarfs.</p>

<p>So she told them how her stepmother
had tried to kill her, how the huntsman
had spared her life, and how she had run
the whole day through, till at last she
had found their little house.</p>

<p>Then the dwarfs said, &ldquo;If thou wilt
keep our house, cook, make the beds,
wash, sew and knit, and make all neat
and clean, thou canst stay with us and
shalt want for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will, right willingly,&rdquo; said Snowdrop.
So she dwelt with them, and
kept their house in order. Every
morning they went out among the
mountains, to seek iron and gold, and
came home ready for supper in the
evening.</p>

<p>The maiden being left alone all day
long, the good dwarfs warned her, saying,
&ldquo;Beware of thy wicked stepmother,
who will soon find out that thou art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
here; take care that thou lettest nobody
in.&rdquo;</p>

alt="The dwarfs find the sleeping Snowdrop" />
</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Oh, Heaven,&rdquo; they cried, &ldquo;what a lovely child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queen, however, after having, as
she thought, eaten Snowdrop&rsquo;s lungs
and liver, had no doubt that she was
again the first and fairest woman in the
world; so she walked up to her mirror,
and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mirror replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here you are fairest of them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But over the hills, with the seven dwarfs old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives Snowdrop, fairer a hundredfold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>She trembled, knowing that the mirror
never told a falsehood; she felt sure
that the huntsman had deceived her,
and that Snowdrop was still alive. She
pondered once more, late and early,
early and late, how best to kill Snowdrop;
for envy gave her no rest, day or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
night, while she herself was not the
fairest lady in the land. When she had
planned what to do she painted her
face, dressed herself like an old pedler-woman,
and altered her appearance so
much that no one could have known
her. In this disguise she went over the
seven hills to where the seven dwarfs
dwelt, knocked at the door, and cried,
&ldquo;Good wares, cheap!&mdash;very cheap!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop looked out of the window
and cried, &ldquo;Good-morning, good woman.
What have you to sell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good wares, smart wares,&rdquo; answered
the queen&mdash;&ldquo;bodice laces of all
colors;&rdquo; and drew out one which was
woven of colored silk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may surely let this honest dame
in!&rdquo; thought Snowdrop; so she unfastened
the door, and bought for herself
the pretty lace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said the old woman, &ldquo;what
a figure thou art! Let me lace thee for
once properly.&rdquo; Snowdrop feared no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
harm, so stepped in front of her, and
allowed her bodice to be fastened up
with the new lace.</p>

<p>But the old woman laced so quick
and laced so tight that Snowdrop&rsquo;s
breath was stopped, and she fell down
as if dead. &ldquo;Now I am fairest at last,&rdquo;
said the old woman to herself, and sped
away.</p>

<p>The seven dwarfs came home soon
after, at eventide, but how alarmed
were they to find their poor Snowdrop
lifeless on the ground! They lifted her
up, and, seeing that she was laced too
tightly, cut the lace of her bodice; she
began to breathe faintly, and slowly
returned to life. When the dwarfs
heard what had happened, they said,
&ldquo;The old pedler-woman was none other
than the wicked queen. Be careful of
thyself, and open the door to no one
if we are not at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cruel stepmother walked up to her
mirror when she reached home, and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>To which it answered, as usual:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here you are fairest of them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But over the hills, with the seven dwarfs old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives Snowdrop, fairer a hundredfold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she heard this she was so
alarmed that all the blood rushed to her
heart, for she saw plainly that Snowdrop
was still alive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will think
of some means that shall destroy her
utterly;&rdquo; and with the help of witchcraft,
in which she was skilful, she
made a poisoned comb. Then she
changed her dress and took the shape
of another old woman.</p>

<p>Again she crossed the seven hills to
the home of the seven dwarfs, knocked
at the door, and cried, &ldquo;Good wares,
very cheap!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
Snowdrop looked out and said, &ldquo;Go
away&mdash;I dare let no one in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may surely be allowed to look!&rdquo;
answered the old woman, and she drew
out the poisoned comb and held it up.
The girl was so pleased with it that she
let herself be cajoled, and opened the
door.</p>

<p>When the bargain was struck the
dame said, &ldquo;Now let me dress your hair
properly for once.&rdquo; Poor Snowdrop
took no heed, and let the old woman
begin; but the comb had scarcely touched
her hair before the poison worked,
and she fell down senseless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paragon of beauty!&rdquo; said the wicked
woman, &ldquo;all is over with thee now,&rdquo;
and went away.</p>

<p>Luckily it was near evening, and the
seven dwarfs soon came home. When
they found Snowdrop lifeless on the
ground they at once distrusted her
stepmother. They searched, and found
the poisoned comb; and as soon as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
had drawn it out, Snowdrop came to
herself, and told them what had happened.
Again they warned her to be
careful, and open the door to no one.</p>

<p>The queen placed herself before the
mirror at home and said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it again answered:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, you are fairest of them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But over the hills, with the seven dwarfs old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives Snowdrop, fairer a thousandfold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she heard the mirror speak
thus she quivered with rage. &ldquo;Snowdrop
shall die,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if it costs
my own life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she went to a secret and lonely
chamber, where no one ever disturbed
her, and compounded an apple of deadly
poison. Ripe and rosy cheeked, it was so
beautiful to look upon that all who saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
it longed for it; but it brought death to
any who should eat it. When the apple
was ready she painted her face, disguised
herself as a peasant-woman, and
journeyed over the seven hills to where
the seven dwarfs dwelt. At the sound
of the knock Snowdrop put her head
out of the window, and said, &ldquo;I cannot
open the door to anybody, for the seven
dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied the peasant-woman;
&ldquo;I only want to be rid of my
apples. Here, I will give you one of
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Snowdrop, &ldquo;I dare not
take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Art thou afraid of being poisoned?&rdquo;
asked the old woman. &ldquo;Look here; I
will cut the apple in two, and you shall
eat the rosy side, and I the white.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the fruit was so cunningly made
that only the rosy side was poisoned.
Snowdrop longed for the pretty apple;
and when she saw the peasant-woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
eating it she could resist no longer, but
stretched out her hand and took the
poisoned half. She had scarcely tasted
it when she fell lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>The queen, laughing loudly, watched
her with a barbarous look, and cried:
&ldquo;Oh, thou who art white as snow, red as
blood, and black as ebony, the seven
dwarfs cannot awaken thee this time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when she asked the mirror at
home,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>the mirror at last replied,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the fairest of them all.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So her envious heart had as much repose
as an envious heart can ever know.</p>

<p>When the dwarfs came home in the
evening they found Snowdrop lying
breathless and motionless on the ground.
They lifted her up, searched whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
she had anything poisonous about her,
unlaced her, combed her hair, washed
her with water and with wine; but all
was useless, for they could not bring
the darling back to life. They laid her
on a bier, and all the seven placed themselves
round it, and mourned for her
three long days. Then they would
have buried her, but that she still looked
so fresh and lifelike, and had such lovely
rosy cheeks. &ldquo;We cannot lower her
into the dark earth,&rdquo; said they; and
caused a transparent coffin of glass to
be made, so that she could be seen on
all sides, and laid her in it, writing her
name outside in letters of gold, which
told that she was the daughter of a king.
Then they placed the coffin on the
mountain above, and one of them always
stayed by it and guarded it. But there
was little need to guard it, for even the
wild animals came and mourned for Snowdrop:
the birds likewise&mdash;first an owl,
and then a raven, and afterwards a dove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
Long, long years did Snowdrop lay
in her coffin unchanged, looking as
though asleep, for she was still white
as snow, red as blood, and her hair was
as black as ebony. At last the son of
a king chanced to wander into the
forest, and came to the dwarf&rsquo;s house
for a night&rsquo;s shelter. He saw the coffin
on the mountain with the beautiful
Snowdrop in it, and read what was written
there in letters of gold. Then he
said to the dwarfs, &ldquo;Let me have the
coffin! I will give you whatever you
like to ask for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the dwarfs answered, &ldquo;We would
not part with it for all the gold in the
world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said again, &ldquo;Yet give it me; for I
cannot live without seeing Snowdrop,
and though she is dead, I will prize and
honor her as my beloved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the good dwarfs took pity on
him, and gave him the coffin. The
prince had it borne away by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
servants. They happened to stumble over
a bush, and the shock forced the bit of
poisoned apple which Snowdrop had
tasted out of her throat. Immediately
she opened her eyes, raised the coffin-lid,
and sat up alive once more. &ldquo;Oh,
heaven!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;where am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The prince answered, joyfully. &ldquo;Thou
art with me,&rdquo; and told her what had
happened, saying, &ldquo;I love thee more
dearly than anything else in the world.
Come with me to my father&rsquo;s castle,
and be my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Snowdrop, well pleased, went with
him, and they were married with much
state and grandeur.</p>

<p>The wicked stepmother was invited
to the feast. Richly dressed, she stood
before the mirror, and asked of it:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little glass upon the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is fairest among us all?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The mirror answered:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Lady queen, so grand and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, you are fairest among them all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the young queen over the mountains old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is fairer than you a thousandfold.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The evil-hearted woman uttered a
curse, and could scarcely endure her
anguish. She first resolved not to attend
the wedding, but curiosity would
not allow her to rest. She determined
to travel, and see who that young queen
could be, who was the most beautiful
in all the world. When she came, and
found that it was Snowdrop alive again,
she stood petrified with terror and despair.
Then two iron shoes, heated
burning hot, were drawn out of the fire
with a pair of tongs, and laid before
her feet. She was forced to put them
on, and to go and dance at Snowdrop&rsquo;s
wedding&mdash;dancing, dancing on these
red hot shoes till she fell down dead.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there were Three
Bears, who lived together in a house
of their own in a wood. One of them
was a Little, Small, Wee Bear; and
one was a Middle-sized Bear, and the
other was a Great, Huge Bear. They
had each a pot for their porridge, a little
pot for the Little, Small, Wee Bear;
and a middle-sized pot for the Middle
Bear; and a great pot for the Great,
Huge Bear. And they had each a chair
to sit in; a little chair for the Little,
Small, Wee Bear; and a middle-sized
chair for the Middle Bear; and a great
chair for the Great, Huge Bear. And
they had each a bed to sleep in; a little
bed for the Little, Small, Wee Bear;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
and a middle-sized bed for the Middle
Bear; and a great bed for the Great,
Huge Bear.</p>

<p>One day, after they had made the
porridge for their breakfast, and poured
it into their porridge-pots, they walked
out into the wood while the porridge
was cooling, that they might not burn
their mouths by beginning too soon to
eat it. And while they were walking
a little old woman came to the house.
She could not have been a good, honest
old woman; for, first, she looked in at
the window, and then she peeped in at
the key-hole; and, seeing nobody in the
house, she lifted the latch. The door
was not fastened, because the bears
were good bears, who did nobody any
harm, and never suspected that anybody
would harm them. So the little
old woman opened the door and went
in, and well pleased she was when she
saw the porridge on the table. If she
had been a good little old woman she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
would have waited till the bears came
home, and then, perhaps, they would
have asked her to breakfast; for they
were good bears&mdash;a little rough or so,
as the manner of bears is, but for all
that very good-natured and hospitable.
But she was an impudent, bad old woman,
and set about helping herself.</p>

<p>So first she tasted the porridge of the
Great, Huge Bear, and that was too
hot for her; and she said a bad word
about that. And then she tasted the
porridge of the Middle Bear, and that
was too cold for her; and she said a bad
word about that, too. And then she
went to the porridge of the Little, Small,
Wee Bear, and tasted that, and that
was neither too hot nor too cold, but
just right, and she liked it so well that
she ate it all up; but the naughty old
woman said a bad word about the little
porridge-pot, because it did not hold
enough for her.</p>

<p>Then the little old woman sate down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
in the chair of the Great, Huge Bear,
and that was too hard for her. And
then she sate down in the chair of the
Middle Bear, and that was too soft for
her. And then she sate down in the
chair of the Little, Small, Wee Bear, and
that was neither too hard nor too soft,
but just right. So she seated herself
in it, and there she sate till the bottom
of the chair came out, and down came
she, plump upon the ground. And the
naughty old woman said a wicked word
about that, too.</p>

<p>Then the little old woman went up-stairs
into the bedchamber in which
the three bears slept. And first she
lay down upon the bed of the Great,
Huge Bear; but that was too high at
the head for her. And next she lay
down upon the bed of the Middle Bear;
and that was too high at the foot for
her. And then she lay down upon the
bed of the Little, Small, Wee Bear; and
that was neither too high at the head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
nor at the foot, but just right. So she
covered herself up comfortably, and
lay there till she fell fast asleep.</p>

<p>By this time the three bears thought
their porridge would be cool enough,
so they came home to breakfast. Now
the little old woman had left the spoon
of the Great, Huge Bear standing in
his porridge.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;SOMEBODY HAS BEEN AT MY
PORRIDGE!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great,
rough, gruff voice. And when the Middle
Bear looked at his, he saw that the
spoon was standing in it, too. They were
wooden spoons; if they had been silver
ones the naughty old woman would
have put them in her pocket.</p>

<p class="center smcap">&ldquo;Somebody Has Been At My Porridge!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
Then the Little, Small, Wee Bear looked
at his, and there was the spoon in
the porridge-pot, but the porridge was
all gone.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>Somebody has been at my porridge,
and has eaten it all up!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his
little, small, wee voice.</p>

<p>Upon this the three bears, seeing that
some one had entered their house, and
eaten up the Little, Small, Wee Bear&rsquo;s
breakfast, began to look about them.
Now the little old woman had not put
the hard cushion straight when she rose
from the chair of the Great, Huge Bear.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;SOMEBODY HAS BEEN SITTING
IN MY CHAIR!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great,
rough, gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old woman had squatted
down the soft cushion of the Middle
Bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span></p>

<p class="center smcap">&ldquo;Somebody Has Been Sitting In
My Chair!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle
voice.</p>

<p>And you know what the little old
woman had done to the third chair.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>Somebody has been sitting in my chair,
and has sate the bottom of it out!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his
little, small, wee voice.</p>

<p>Then the three bears thought it necessary
that they should make further
search, so they went up-stairs into their
bedchamber. Now the little old woman
had pulled the pillow of the Great,
Huge Bear out of its place.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;SOMEBODY HAS BEEN LYING IN MY BED!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Great, Huge Bear, in his great,
rough, gruff voice.</p>

<p>And the little old woman had pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
the bolster of the Middle Bear out of
its place.</p>

<p class="center smcap">&ldquo;Somebody Has Been Lying in My
Bed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Middle Bear, in his middle voice.</p>

<p>And when the Little, Small, Wee Bear
came to look at his bed, there was the
bolster in its place, and the pillow in
its place upon the bolster, and upon the
pillow was the little old woman&rsquo;s ugly,
dirty head&mdash;which was not in its place,
for she had no business there.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<i>Somebody has been lying in my bed&mdash;and
here she is!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>said the Little, Small, Wee Bear, in his
little, small, wee voice.</p>

<p class="caption">The voice of the little, small, wee bear awakened her at once</p>

<p>The little old woman had heard in
her sleep the great, rough, gruff voice
of the Great, Huge Bear; but she was so
fast asleep that it was no more to her
than the roaring of wind or the rumbling
of thunder. And she had heard the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
middle voice of the Middle Bear, but it
was only as if she had heard some one
speaking in a dream. But when she
heard the little, small, wee voice of the
Little, Small, Wee Bear, it was so sharp
and so shrill that it awakened her at
once. Up she started; and when she
saw the Three Bears on one side of the
bed she tumbled herself out at the other
and ran to the window. Now the
window was open, because the bears,
like good, tidy bears as they were, always
opened their bedchamber window
when they got up in the morning.
Out the little old woman jumped; and
whether she broke her neck in the fall,
or ran into the wood and was lost there,
or found her way out of the wood and
was taken up by the constable and sent
to the House of Correction for a vagrant
as she was, I cannot tell. But the Three
Bears never saw anything more of her.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> POOR widow lived alone in a little
cottage, in front of which was a
garden, where stood two little rose-trees:
one bore white roses, the other
red. The widow had two children who
resembled the two rose-trees: one was
called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.
They were two of the best children
that ever lived; but Snow-white was
quieter and more gentle than Rose-red.
Rose-red liked best to jump about in
the meadows, to look for flowers and
catch butterflies; but Snow-white sat at
home with her mother, helped her in the
house, or read to her when there was
nothing else to do. The two children
loved one another so much that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
always walked hand in hand; and
when Snow-white said, &ldquo;We will not
forsake one another,&rdquo; Rose-red answered,
&ldquo;Never, as long as we live;&rdquo; and the
mother added, &ldquo;Yes, my children, whatever
one has, let her divide with the
other.&rdquo; They often ran about in solitary
places, and gathered red berries;
and the wild creatures of the wood
never hurt them, but came confidingly
up to them. The little hare ate cabbage-leaves
out of their hands, the doe
grazed at their side, the stag sprang
merrily past them, and the birds remained
sitting on the boughs, and never
ceased their songs. They met with no
accident if they loitered in the wood
and night came on; they lay down together
on the moss, and slept till morning;
and the mother knew this, and was
in no anxiety about them. Once, when
they had spent the night in the wood,
and the red morning awoke them, they
saw a beautiful child, in a shining white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
dress, sitting by the place where they
had slept, who, arising, and looking at
them kindly, said nothing, but went
into the wood. And when they looked
round they found out that they had
been sleeping close to a precipice, and
would certainly have fallen down it if
they had gone a few steps farther in the
dark. Their mother told them it must
have been the angel that takes care of
good children who had sat by them all
night long.</p>

<p>Snow-white and Rose-red kept their
mother&rsquo;s cottage so clean that it was
a pleasure to look into it. In the summer
Rose-red managed the house, and
every morning she gathered a nosegay
in which was a rose off each tree, and
set it by her mother&rsquo;s bed before she
awoke. In winter Snow-white lighted
the fire, and hung the kettle on the
hook; and though it was only copper
it shone like gold, it was rubbed so
clean. In the evening, when the snow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
fell, the mother said, &ldquo;Go, Snow-white,
and bolt the door;&rdquo; and then they seated
themselves on the hearth, and the
mother took her spectacles, and read
aloud out of a great book, and the two
girls listened, and sat and span. Near
them lay a lamb on the floor, and behind
them, on a perch, sat a white dove, with
its head under its wing.</p>

<p>One evening, as they were thus happy
together, some one knocked to be
let in. The mother said, &ldquo;Quick, Rose-red,
open the door; perhaps it is a
traveller who seeks shelter.&rdquo; Rose-red
went and pushed the bolt back, and
thought it was a poor man; but a bear
stretched his thick black head into the
door. Rose-red screamed and sprang
back, the little lamb bleated, the little
dove fluttered about, and Snow-white
hid herself behind her mother&rsquo;s bed.
However, the bear began to speak, and
said, &ldquo;Do not be frightened, I will
do you no harm; I am half frozen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
and only want to warm myself a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor bear,&rdquo; said the mother,
&ldquo;lay yourself down before the fire,
only take care your fur does not burn.&rdquo;
Then she called out: &ldquo;Snow-white and
Rose-red, come out; the bear will not
hurt you&mdash;he means honestly by us.&rdquo;
Then they both came out, and, by
degrees, the lamb and the dove also
approached, and ceased to be afraid.
The bear said, &ldquo;Children, knock the
snow a little out of my fur;&rdquo; and they
fetched a broom, and swept the bear&rsquo;s
skin clean; and he stretched himself
before the fire and growled softly, like
a bear that was quite happy and comfortable.
In a short time they all became
quite friendly together, and the
children played tricks with the awkward
guest. They pulled his hair, set
their feet on his back, and rolled him
here and there; or took a hazel rod and
beat him, and when he growled they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
laughed. The bear was very much
pleased with this frolic, only, when
they became too mischievous, he called
out: &ldquo;Children, leave me alone.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Little Snow-white and Rose-red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will strike your lover dead.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>When bedtime came, and the others
went to sleep, the mother said to the
bear: &ldquo;You can lie there on the hearth,
and then you will be sheltered from the
cold and the bad weather.&rdquo; At daybreak
the two children let him out,
and he trotted over the snow into the
wood. Henceforward the bear came
every evening at the same hour, laid
himself on the hearth, and allowed the
children to play with him as much as
they liked; and they became so used
to him that the door was never bolted
until their black companion had arrived.
When spring came, and everything
was green out-of-doors, the bear
said one morning to Snow-white: &ldquo;Now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
I must go away, and may not come
again the whole summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, dear Bear?&rdquo;
asked Snow-white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go into the wood, and guard
my treasures from the bad dwarfs; in
winter, when the ground is frozen hard,
they have to stay underneath, and cannot
work their way through, but now
that the sun has thawed and warmed
the earth, they break through, come
up, seek, and steal; what is once in their
hands, and lies in their caverns, does
not come so easily into daylight again.&rdquo;
Snow-white was quite sorrowful at
parting, and as she unbolted the door
for him, and the bear ran out, the hook
of the door caught him, and a piece of
his skin tore off; it seemed to Snow-white
as if she had seen gold shining
through, but she was not sure. But
the bear ran quickly away, and soon
disappeared behind the trees.</p>

<p>After some time, their mother sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
the children into the wood to collect
fagots. They found there a large tree,
which had been cut down and lay on
the ground, and by the trunk something
was jumping up and down, but
they could not tell what it was. As
they came nearer they saw that it was
a dwarf with an old withered face, and
a snow-white beard a yard long. The
end of the beard was stuck fast in a
cleft in the tree, and the little fellow
jumped about like a dog on a rope, and
did not know how to help himself. He
stared at the girls with his fiery red
eyes, and screamed out: &ldquo;Why do you
stand there? Can&rsquo;t you come and render
me some assistance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with you, little
man?&rdquo; asked Rose-red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stupid little goose!&rdquo; answered the
dwarf; &ldquo;I wanted to chop the tree, so
as to have some small pieces of wood
for the kitchen; we only want little bits;
with thick logs the small quantity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
food that we cook for ourselves&mdash;we
are not, like you, great greedy people&mdash;burns
directly. I had driven the
wedge well in, and it was all going on
right, but the detestable wood was too
smooth, and sprang out unexpectedly;
and the tree closed up so quickly that
I could not pull my beautiful white
beard out; now it is sticking there, and
I can&rsquo;t get away. There, you foolish,
soft, milk-faces, you are laughing and
crying out: &lsquo;How ugly you are! how
ugly you are!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children took a great deal of
trouble, but they could not pull the
beard out; it stuck too fast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will run and fetch somebody,&rdquo;
said Rose-red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You great ninny!&rdquo; snarled the
dwarf, &ldquo;to want to call more people;
you are too many for me now. Can&rsquo;t
you think of anything better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only don&rsquo;t be impatient,&rdquo; said
Snow-white. &ldquo;I have thought of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
something;&rdquo; and she took her little scissors
out of her pocket, and cut the end of
the beard off.</p>

<p>As soon as the dwarf felt himself free
he seized a sack filled with gold that was
sticking between the roots of the tree;
pulling it out, he growled to himself:
&ldquo;You rude people, to cut off a piece of
my beautiful beard! May evil reward
you!&rdquo; Then he threw his sack over
his shoulders, and walked away without
once looking at the children.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards Snow-white
and Rose-red wished to catch some fish
for dinner. As they came near to the
stream they saw that something like a
grasshopper was jumping towards the
water, as if it were going to spring
in. They ran on and recognized the
dwarf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Rose-red.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go into the
water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not such a fool as that,&rdquo; cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
the dwarf. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the detestable
fish wants to pull me in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little fellow had been sitting there
fishing, and, unluckily, the wind had entangled
his beard with the line. When
directly afterwards a great fish bit at
his hook the weak creature could not
pull him out, so the fish was pulling the
dwarf into the water. It is true he
caught hold of all the reeds and rushes,
but that did not help him much; he
had to follow all the movements of the
fish, and was in imminent danger of
being drowned. The girls, coming at
the right time, held him fast and tried
to get the beard loose from the line, but
in vain&mdash;beard and line were entangled
fast together. There was nothing to
do but to pull out the scissors and to cut
off the beard, in doing which a little
piece of it was lost. When the dwarf
saw that, he cried out: &ldquo;Is that manners,
you goose! to disfigure one&rsquo;s face
so? Is it not enough that you once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
cut my beard shorter? But now you
have cut the best part of it off, I dare
not be seen by my people. I wish you
had had to run, and had lost the soles
of your shoes!&rdquo; Then he fetched a sack
of pearls that lay among the rushes,
and, without saying a word more, he
dragged it away and disappeared behind
a stone.</p>

<p>Soon after the mother sent the two
girls to the town to buy cotton, needles,
cord, and tape. The road led them by
a heath, scattered over which lay great
masses of rock. There they saw a large
bird hovering in the air; it flew round
and round just above them, always sinking
lower and lower, and at last it settled
down by a rock not far distant.
Directly after they heard a piercing,
wailing cry. They ran up, and saw
with horror that the eagle had seized
their old acquaintance, the dwarf, and
was going to carry him off. The compassionate
children instantly seized hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
of the little man, held him fast, and
struggled so long that the eagle let his
prey go.</p>

<p>When the dwarf had recovered from
his first fright, he called out, in his
shrill voice: &ldquo;Could not you deal rather
more gently with me? You have torn
my thin coat all in tatters, awkward,
clumsy creatures that you are!&rdquo; Then
he took a sack of precious stones, and
slipped behind the rock again into his
den. The girls, who were used to his
ingratitude, went on their way, and
completed their business in the town.
As they were coming home again over
the heath they surprised the dwarf,
who had emptied his sack of precious
stones on a little clean place, and had
not thought that any one would come
by there so late. The evening sun shone
on the glittering stones, which looked
so beautiful in all their colors that the
children could not help standing still
to gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why do you stand there gaping?&rdquo;
cried the dwarf, his ash-colored face
turning vermilion with anger.</p>

<p>With these cross words he was going
away when he heard a loud roaring,
and a black bear trotted out of the
woods towards them. The dwarf sprang
up terrified, but he could not get to his
lurking-hole again&mdash;the bear was already
close upon him. Then he called
out in anguish:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, and you
shall have all my treasures; look at the
beautiful precious stones that lie there.
Give me my life; for what do you want
with a poor thin little fellow like me?
You would scarcely feel me between
your teeth. Rather seize those two
wicked girls; they will be tender morsels
for you, as fat as young quails; pray,
eat them at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bear, without troubling himself
to answer, gave the malicious creature
one single stroke with his paw, and he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
did not move again. The girls had run
away, but the bear called after them:
&ldquo;Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be
frightened; wait, I will go with you.&rdquo;
Recognizing the voice of their old
friend, they stood still, and when the
bear came up to them his skin suddenly
fell off; and behold he was not a bear,
but a handsome young man dressed all
in gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am a king&rsquo;s son,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I was
changed by the wicked dwarf, who had
stolen all my treasures, into a wild bear,
and obliged to run about in the wood
until I should be freed by his death.
Now he has received his well-deserved
punishment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So they all went home together to
the widow&rsquo;s cottage, and Snow-white
was married to the prince and Rose-red
to his brother. They divided between
them the great treasures which
the dwarf had amassed. The old mother
lived many quiet and happy years with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
her children; but when she left her cottage
for the palace she took the two
rose-trees with her, and they stood before
her window and bore every year
the most beautiful roses&mdash;one white
and the other red.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>AR away, where the swallows take
refuge in winter, lived a king who
had eleven sons and one daughter, Elise.
The eleven brothers&mdash;they were all
princes&mdash;used to go to school with stars
on their breasts and swords at their
sides. They wrote upon golden slates
with diamond pencils, and could read
just as well without a book as with one,
so there was no mistake about their
being real princes. Their sister Elise
sat upon a little footstool of looking-glass,
and she had a picture-book which
had cost the half of a kingdom. Oh,
these children were very happy; but
it was not to last thus forever.</p>

<p>Their father, who was king over all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
the land, married a wicked queen who
was not at all kind to the poor children;
they found that out on the first day.
All was festive at the castle, but when
the children wanted to play at having
company, instead of having as many
cakes and baked apples as ever they
wanted, she would only let them have
some sand in a tea-cup, and said they
must make-believe.</p>

<p>In the following week she sent little
Elise into the country to board with
some peasants, and it did not take her
long to make the king believe so many
bad things about the boys that he
cared no more about them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fly out into the world and look
after yourselves,&rdquo; said the wicked queen;
&ldquo;you shall fly about like birds without
voices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she could not make things as bad
for them as she would have liked; they
turned into eleven beautiful wild swans.
They flew out of the palace window
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
with a weird scream, right across the
park and the woods.</p>

<p>It was very early in the morning
when they came to the place where
their sister Elise was sleeping in the
peasant&rsquo;s house. They hovered over
the roof of the house, turning and twisting
their long necks, and flapping their
wings; but no one either heard or saw
them. They had to fly away again,
and they soared up towards the clouds,
far out into the wide world, and they
settled in a big, dark wood, which
stretched right down to the shore.</p>

<p>Poor little Elise stood in the peasant&rsquo;s
room, playing with a green leaf,
for she had no other toys. She made a
little hole in it, which she looked through
at the sun, and it seemed to her as if
she saw her brothers&rsquo; bright eyes.
Every time the warm sunbeams shone
upon her cheek it reminded her of their
kisses. One day passed just like another.
When the wind whistled through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
the rose-hedges outside the house, it
whispered to the roses: &ldquo;Who can be
prettier than you are?&rdquo; But the roses
shook their heads and answered: &ldquo;Elise!&rdquo;
And when the old woman sat in the
doorway reading her Psalms the wind
turned over the leaves and said to the
book: &ldquo;Who can be more pious than
you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Elise!&rdquo; answered the book.
Both the roses and the book of Psalms
only spoke the truth.</p>

<p>She was to go home when she was
fifteen, but when the queen saw how
pretty she was she got very angry, and
her heart was filled with hatred. She
would willingly have turned her into
a wild swan too, like her brothers, but
she did not dare to do it at once, for
the king wanted to see his daughter.
The queen always went to the bath in
the early morning. It was built of
marble, and adorned with soft cushions
and beautiful carpets.</p>

<p>She took three toads, kissed them,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
and said to the first: &ldquo;Sit upon Elise&rsquo;s
head when she comes to the bath, so
that she may become sluggish like
yourself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sit upon her forehead,&rdquo;
she said to the second, &ldquo;that she may
become ugly like you, and then her
father won&rsquo;t know her! Rest upon her
heart,&rdquo; she whispered to the third.
&ldquo;Let an evil spirit come over her, which
may be a burden to her.&rdquo; Then she
put the toads into the clean water, and
a green tinge immediately came over it.
She called Elise, undressed her, and
made her go into the bath; when she
ducked under the water, one of the
toads got among her hair, the other
got onto her forehead, and the third
onto her bosom. But when she stood
up three scarlet poppies floated on the
water; had not the creatures been
poisonous, and kissed by the sorceress,
they would have been changed into
crimson roses, but yet they became
flowers from merely having rested a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
moment on her head and her heart.
She was far too good and innocent for
the sorcery to have any power over her.
When the wicked queen saw this she
rubbed her over with walnut juice, and
smeared her face with some evil-smelling
salve. She also matted up her
beautiful hair; it would have been impossible
to recognize pretty Elise. When
her father saw her, he was quite horrified,
and said that she could not be his
daughter. Nobody would have anything
to say to her, except the yard
dog and the swallows, and they were
only poor dumb animals whose opinion
went for nothing.</p>

<p>Poor Elise wept, and thought of her
eleven brothers who were all lost. She
crept sadly out of the palace and wandered
about all day, over meadows and
marshes, and into a big forest. She
did not know in the least where she
wanted to go, but she felt very sad,
and longed for her brothers, who, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
doubt, like herself had been driven out
of the palace. She made up her mind
to go and look for them, but she had
only been in the wood for a short time
when night fell. She had quite lost
her way, so she lay down upon the soft
moss, said her evening prayer, and
rested her head on a little hillock. It
was very still and the air was mild;
hundreds of glow-worms shone around
her on the grass and in the marsh like
green fire. When she gently moved
one of the branches over her head the
little shining insects fell over her like
a shower of stars. She dreamed about
her brothers all night long. Again
they were children playing together:
they wrote upon the golden slates with
their diamond pencils, and she looked at
the picture-book which had cost half
a kingdom. But they no longer wrote
strokes and noughts upon their slates
as they used to do; no, they wrote down
all their boldest exploits, and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
that they had seen and experienced.
Everything in the picture-book
was alive, the birds sang, and the people
walked out of the book, and spoke to
Elise and her brothers. When she turned
over a page they skipped back into
their places again, so that there should
be no confusion among the pictures.</p>

<p>When she woke the sun was already
high; it is true she could not see it very
well through the thick branches of the
lofty forest trees, but the sunbeams
cast a golden shimmer around beyond
the forest. There was a fresh, delicious
scent of grass and herbs in the air, and
the birds were almost ready to perch
upon her shoulders. She could hear
the splashing of water, for there were
many springs around, which all flowed
into a pond with a lovely sandy bottom.
It was surrounded with thick
bushes, but there was one place which
the stags had trampled down, and Elise
passed through the opening to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
water side. It was so transparent
that had not the branches been moved
by the breeze she must have thought
that they were painted on the bottom,
so plainly was every leaf reflected, both
those on which the sun played, and
those which were in shade.</p>

<p>When she saw her own face she was
quite frightened, it was so brown and
ugly; but when she wet her little hand
and rubbed her eyes and forehead her
white skin shone through again. Then
she took off all her clothes and went
into the fresh water. A more beautiful
royal child than she could not be
found in all the world.</p>

<p>When she had put on her clothes
again and plaited her long hair she
went to a sparkling spring, and drank
some of the water out of the hollow of
her hand. Then she wandered farther
into the wood, though where she was
going she had not the least idea. She
thought of her brothers, and she thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
of a merciful God who would not forsake
her. He let the wild crab-apples
grow to feed the hungry. He showed
her a tree, the branches of which were
bending beneath their weight of fruit.
Here she made her midday meal, and,
having put props under the branches,
she walked on into the thickest part of
the forest. It was so quiet that she
heard her own footsteps; she heard
every little withered leaf which bent
under her feet. Not a bird was to be
seen, not a ray of sunlight pierced the
leafy branches, and the tall trunks were
so close together that when she looked
before her it seemed as if a thick fence
of heavy beams hemmed her in on
every side. The solitude was such as
she had never known before.</p>

<p>It was a very dark night, not a single
glow-worm sparkled in the marsh; sadly
she lay down to sleep, and it seemed
to her as if the branches above her
parted asunder, and the Saviour looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
down upon her with His loving eyes,
and little angels&rsquo; heads peeped out
above His head and under His arms.</p>

<p>When she woke in the morning she
was not sure if she had dreamed this,
or whether it was really true.</p>

<p>She walked a little farther, when she
met an old woman with a basket full
of berries, of which she gave her some.
Elise asked if she had seen eleven
princes ride through the wood. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said the old woman, &ldquo;but yesterday I
saw eleven swans, with golden crowns
upon their heads, swimming in the
stream close by here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led Elise a little farther to a slope,
at the foot of which the stream meandered.
The trees on either bank stretched
out their rich, leafy branches towards
each other, and where, from their
natural growth, they could not reach
each other, they had torn their roots
out of the ground, and leaned over the
water so as to interlace their branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
Elise said good-bye to the old woman
and walked along by the river till
it flowed out into the great open sea.</p>

<p>The beautiful open sea lay before the
maiden, but not a sail was to be seen
on it&mdash;not a single boat. How was she
ever to get any farther? She looked at
the numberless little pebbles on the
beach; they were all worn quite round
by the water. Glass, iron, stone,
whatever was washed up, had taken their
shapes from the water, which yet was
much softer than her little hand.
&ldquo;With all its rolling, it is untiring, and
everything hard is smoothed down. I
will be just as untiring! Thank you
for your lesson, you clear rolling waves!
Some time, so my poor heart tells me,
you will bear me to my beloved brothers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Eleven white swans&rsquo; feathers were
lying on the sea-weed; she picked them
up and made a bunch of them. There were
still drops of water on them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
Whether these were dew or tears no
one could tell. It was very lonely
there by the shore, but she did not feel
it, for the sea was ever changing. There
were more changes on it in the course
of a few hours than could be seen on
an inland fresh-water lake in a year.
If a big black cloud arose it was just
as if the sea wanted to say, &ldquo;I can look
black too,&rdquo; and then the wind blew up
and the waves showed their white
crests. But if the clouds were red and
the wind dropped, the sea looked like
a rose-leaf, now white, now green. But,
however still it was, there was always
a little gentle motion just by the shore;
the water rose and fell softly, like the
bosom of a sleeping child.</p>

<p>When the sun was just about to go
down, Elise saw eleven wild swans with
golden crowns upon their heads flying
towards the shore. They flew in a
swaying line, one behind the other, like
a white ribbon streamer. Elise climbed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
up onto the bank and hid behind a
bush; the swans settled close by her
and flapped their great white wings.</p>

<p>As soon as the sun had sunk beneath
the water the swans shed their feathers
and became eleven handsome princes;
they were Elise&rsquo;s brothers. Although
they had altered a good deal, she knew
them at once; she felt that they must
be her brothers, and she sprang into their
arms, calling them by name. They
were delighted when they recognized
their little sister who had grown so big
and beautiful. They laughed and cried,
and told each other how wickedly their
stepmother had treated them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We brothers,&rdquo; said the eldest, &ldquo;have
to fly about in the guise of swans, as
long as the sun is above the horizon.
When it goes down we regain our human
shapes. So we always have to
look out for a resting-place near sunset,
for should we happen to be flying
up among the clouds when the sun goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
down we should be hurled to the
depths below. We do not live here;
there is another land, just as beautiful
as this, beyond the sea; but the way to
it is very long, and we have to cross the
mighty ocean to get to it. There is not
a single island on the way where we
can spend the night; only one solitary
little rock juts up above the water midway.
It is only just big enough for us
to stand upon close together, and if
there is a heavy sea the water splashes
over us, yet we thank our God for it.
We stay there over night in our human
forms, and without it we could never
revisit our beloved Fatherland, for our
flight takes two of the longest days in
the year. We are only permitted to
visit the home of our fathers once a
year, and we dare only stay for eleven
days. We hover over this big forest
from whence we catch a glimpse of the
palace where we were born, and where
our father lives; beyond it we can see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
the high church towers where our mother
is buried. We fancy that the trees
and bushes here are related to us; and
the wild horses gallop over the moors,
as we used to see them in our childhood.
The charcoal burners still sing the old
songs we used to dance to when we
were children. This is our Fatherland,
we are drawn towards it, and here we
have found you again, dear little sister!
We may stay here two days longer, and
then we must fly away again across the
ocean to a lovely country indeed, but
it is not our own dear Fatherland. How
shall we ever take you with us! We
have neither ship nor boat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I deliver you!&rdquo; said their
sister, and they went on talking to each
other nearly all night; they only dozed
for a few hours.</p>

<p>Elise was awakened in the morning
by the rustling of the swans&rsquo; wings
above her; her brothers were again
transformed, and were wheeling round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
in great circles till she lost sight of
them in the distance. One of them,
the youngest, stayed behind. He laid
his head against her bosom, and she
caressed it with her fingers. They remained
together all day. Towards evening
the others came back, and as soon
as the sun went down they took their
natural forms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-morrow we must fly away, and
we dare not come back for a whole year,
but we can&rsquo;t leave you like this! Have
you courage to go with us? My arm
is strong enough to carry you over the
forest, so surely our united strength
ought to be sufficient to bear you across
the ocean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; take me with you,&rdquo; said
Elise.</p>

<p>They spent the whole night in weaving
a kind of net of the elastic bark of the
willow bound together with tough
rushes; they made it both large and
strong. Elise lay down upon it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
when the sun rose and the brothers became
swans again they took up the net
in their bills and flew high up among
the clouds with their precious sister,
who was fast asleep. The sunbeams
fell straight onto her face, so one of the
swans flew over her head so that its
broad wings should shade her.</p>

<p>They were far from land when Elise
woke; she thought she must still be
dreaming, it seemed so strange to be
carried through the air so high up
above the sea. By her side lay a
branch of beautiful ripe berries and
a bundle of savory roots which her
youngest brother had collected for her,
and for which she gave him a grateful
smile. She knew it was he who flew
above her head shading her from the
sun. They were so high up that the
first ship they saw looked like a gull
floating on the water. A great cloud
came up behind them like a mountain,
and Elise saw the shadow of herself on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
it, and those of the eleven swans looking
like giants. It was a more beautiful
picture than any she had ever seen before,
but as the sun rose higher, the
cloud fell behind, and the shadow picture
disappeared.</p>

<p>They flew on and on all day like an
arrow whizzing through the air, but
they went slower than usual, for now
they had their sister to carry. A storm
came up, and night was drawing on;
Elise saw the sun sinking with terror in
her heart, for the solitary rock was nowhere
to be seen. The swans seemed
to be taking stronger strokes than ever;
alas! she was the cause of their not being
able to get on faster; as soon as the
sun went down they would become men,
and they would all be hurled into the
sea and drowned. She prayed to God
from the bottom of her heart, but still
no rock was to be seen! Black clouds
gathered, and strong gusts of wind announced
a storm; the clouds looked like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>237]</a></span>
a great threatening leaden wave, and
the flashes of lightning followed each
other rapidly.</p>

<p>The sun was now at the edge of the
sea. Elise&rsquo;s heart quaked, when suddenly
the swans shot downward so
suddenly that she thought they were
falling then they hovered again. Half
of the sun was below the horizon, and
there for the first time she saw the little
rock below, which did not look
bigger than the head of a seal above the
water. The sun sank very quickly, it
was no bigger than a star, but her foot
touched solid earth. The sun went out
like the last sparks of a bit of burning
paper; she saw her brothers stand arm
in arm around her, but there was only
just room enough for them. The waves
beat upon the rock and washed over
them like drenching rain. The heavens
shone with continuous fire, and the
thunder rolled, peal upon peal. But the
sister and brothers held one another&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
hands and sang a psalm which gave
them comfort and courage.</p>

<p>The air was pure and still at dawn.
As soon as the sun rose the swans flew
off with Elise, away from the islet.
The sea still ran high; it looked from
where they were as if the white foam
on the dark green water were millions
of swans floating on the waves.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Elise saw an ice palace, with one bold colonnade built above another</p>

<p>When the sun rose higher Elise saw
before her, half floating in the air, great
masses of ice, with shining glaciers on
the heights. A palace was perched
midway a mile in length, with one bold
colonnade built above another. Beneath
them swayed palm-trees and
gorgeous blossoms as big as mill wheels.
She asked if this was the land to which
she was going, but the swans shook
their heads, because what she saw was
a mirage&mdash;the beautiful and ever-changing
palace of Fata Morgana. No mortal
dared enter it. Elise gazed at it;
but as she gazed the palace, gardens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
and mountains melted away, and in
their place stood twenty proud churches
with their high towers and pointed
windows. She seemed to hear the
notes of the organ, but it was the sea
she heard. When she got close to the
seeming churches they changed to a
great navy sailing beneath her; but it
was only a sea mist passing before her
eyes, and now she saw the real land she
was bound to. Beautiful blue mountains
rose before her with their cedar
woods and palaces. Long before the
sun went down she sat among the hills
in front of a big cave covered with
delicate green creepers. It looked like
a piece of embroidery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we shall see what you will
dream here to-night,&rdquo; said the youngest
brother, as he showed her where she
was to sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If only I might dream how I could
deliver you,&rdquo; she said, and this thought
filled her mind entirely. She prayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
earnestly to God for His help, and even
in her sleep she continued her prayer.
It seemed to her that she was flying up
to Fata Morgana in her castle in the
air. The fairy came towards her; she
was charming and brilliant, and yet she
was very like the old woman who gave
her the berries in the wood and told
her about the swans with the golden
crowns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your brothers can be delivered,&rdquo;
she said; &ldquo;but have you courage and
endurance enough for it? The sea is
indeed softer than your hands, and it
molds the hardest stones; but it does
not feel the pain your fingers will feel.
It has no heart, and does not suffer the
pain and anguish you must feel. Do
you see this stinging nettle I hold in
my hand? Many of this kind grow
round the cave where you sleep; only
these and the ones which grow in the
church-yards may be used. Mark that!
Those you may pluck, although they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
will burn and blister your hands.
Crush the nettles with your feet and
you will have flax, and of this you
must weave eleven coats of mail with
long sleeves. Throw these over the
eleven wild swans and the charm is
broken! But remember that from the
moment you begin this work till it is
finished, even if it takes years, you
must not utter a word! The first word
you say will fall like a murderer&rsquo;s dagger
into the hearts of your brothers.
Their lives hang on your tongue. Mark
this well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She touched her hand at the same
moment&mdash;it was like burning fire&mdash;and
woke Elise. It was bright daylight,
and close to where she slept lay a nettle
like those in her dream. She fell upon
her knees with thanks to God, and left
the cave to begin her work.</p>

<p>She seized the horrid nettles with her
delicate hands, and they burnt like
fire; great blisters rose on her hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
and arms, but she suffered it willingly
if only it would deliver her beloved
brothers. She crushed every nettle
with her bare feet, and twisted it into
green flax.</p>

<p>When the sun went down and the
brothers came back they were alarmed
at finding her mute; they thought it
was some new witchcraft exercised by
their wicked stepmother. But when
they saw her hands they understood
that it was for their sakes; the youngest
brother wept, and wherever his tears
fell she felt no more pain and the
blisters disappeared.</p>

<p>She spent the whole night at her work,
for she could not rest till she had delivered
her dear brothers. All the following
day while her brothers were
away she sat solitary, but never had
the time flown so fast. One coat of
mail was finished, and she began the
next. Then a hunting-horn sounded
among the mountains; she was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
frightened; the sound came nearer, and
she heard dogs barking. In terror she
rushed into the cave, and tied the
nettles she had collected and woven
into a bundle, upon which she sat.</p>

<p>At this moment a big dog bounded
forward from the thicket, and another
and another; they barked loudly, and
ran backward and forward. In a few
minutes all the huntsmen were standing
outside the cave, and the handsomest
of them was the king of the country.
He stepped up to Elise; never had he
seen so lovely a girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How came you here, beautiful
child?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Elise shook her head; she dared not
speak; the salvation and the lives of her
brothers depended upon her silence.
She hid her hands under her apron, so
that the king should not see what she
suffered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you cannot
stay here. If you are as good as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
you are beautiful I will dress you in
silks and velvets, put a golden crown
upon your head, and you shall live with
me and have your home in my richest
palace!&rdquo; Then he lifted her upon his
horse: she wept and wrung her hands,
but the king said: &ldquo;I only think of your
happiness; you will thank me one day
for what I am doing!&rdquo; Then he darted
off across the mountains, holding her
before him on his horse, and the huntsmen
followed.</p>

<p>When the sun went down the royal
city with churches and cupolas lay before
them, and the king led her into the
palace, where great fountains played in
the marble halls, and where walls and
ceilings were adorned with paintings;
but she had no eyes for them, she only
wept and sorrowed. Passively she allowed
the women to dress her in royal robes,
to twist pearls into her hair, and
to draw gloves onto her blistered hands.</p>

<p>She was dazzlingly lovely as she stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
there in all her magnificence; the courtiers
bent low before her, and the king
wooed her as his bride, although the
archbishop shook his head, and whispered
that he feared the beautiful wood
maiden was a witch who had dazzled
their eyes and infatuated the king.</p>

<p>The king refused to listen to him; he
ordered the music to play, the richest
food to be brought, and the loveliest
girls to dance before her. She was led
through scented gardens into gorgeous
apartments, but nothing brought a
smile to her lips or into her eyes; sorrow
sat there like a heritage and a possession
for all time. Last of all, the king
opened the door of a little chamber
close by the room where she was to
sleep. It was adorned with costly
green carpets, and made to exactly resemble
the cave where he found her.
On the floor lay the bundle of flax she
had spun from the nettles, and from
the ceiling hung the shirt of mail which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
was already finished. One of the huntsmen
had brought all these things away
as curiosities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here you may dream that you are
back in your former home!&rdquo; said the
king. &ldquo;Here is the work upon which
you were engaged; in the midst of your
splendor, it may amuse you to think
of those times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Elise saw all those things so
dear to her heart, a smile for the first
time played about her lips, and the
blood rushed back to her cheeks. She
thought of the deliverance of her brothers,
and she kissed the king&rsquo;s hand; he
pressed her to his heart, and ordered all
the church bells to ring marriage peals.
The lovely dumb girl from the woods
was to be queen of the country.</p>

<p>The archbishop whispered evil words
into the ear of the king, but they did
not reach his heart. The wedding was
to take place, and the archbishop himself
had to put the crown upon her head.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
In his anger he pressed the golden circlet
so tightly upon her head as to give
her pain. But a heavier circlet pressed
upon her heart&mdash;her grief for her brothers;
so she thought nothing of the bodily
pain. Her lips were sealed, a single
word from her mouth would cost her
brothers their lives, but her eyes were
full of love for the good and handsome
king, who did everything he could to
please her. Every day she grew more
and more attached to him, and longed
to confide in him, tell him her sufferings;
but dumb she must remain, and in silence
must bring her labor to completion.
Therefore at night she stole away from
his side into her secret chamber, which
was decorated like a cave, and here she
knitted one shirt after another. When
she came to the seventh all her flax
was worked up; she knew that these
nettles which she was to use grew in
the church-yard, but she had to pluck
them herself. How was she to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
there? &ldquo;Oh, what is the pain of my
fingers compared with the anguish of
my heart?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I must venture
out; the good God will not desert
me!&rdquo; With as much terror in her heart
as if she were doing some evil deed she
stole down one night into the moonlit
garden, and through the long alleys
out into the silent streets to the church-yard.
There she saw, sitting on a gravestone,
a group of hideous ghouls,
who took off their tattered garments,
as if they were about to bathe, and then
they dug down into the freshly made
graves with their skinny fingers, and
tore the flesh from the bodies and devoured
it. Elise had to pass close by
them, and they fixed their evil eyes
upon her; but she said a prayer as she
passed, picked the stinging nettles, and
hurried back to the palace with them.</p>

<p>Only one person saw her, but that
was the archbishop, who watched while
others slept. Surely now all his bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
opinions of the queen were justified;
all was not as it should be with her; she
must be a witch, and therefore she had
bewitched the king and all the people.</p>

<p>He told the king in the confessional
what he had seen and what he feared.
When those bad words passed his lips
the pictures of the saints shook their
heads as if to say: It is not so; Elise is
innocent. The archbishop, however, took
it differently, and thought that they
were bearing witness against her, and
shaking their heads at her sin. Two
big tears rolled down the king&rsquo;s cheeks,
and he went home with doubt in his
heart. He pretended to sleep at night,
but no quiet sleep came to his eyes.
He perceived how Elise got up and went
to her private closet. Day by day his
face grew darker; Elise saw it, but could
not imagine what was the cause of it.
It alarmed her, and what was she not
already suffering in her heart because
of her brothers? Her salt tears ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
down upon the royal purple velvet,
they lay upon it like sparkling diamonds,
and all who saw their splendor wished
to be queen.</p>

<p>She had, however, almost reached
the end of her labors, only one shirt of
mail was wanting; but again she had no
more flax, and not a single nettle was
left. Once more, for the last time, she
must go to the church-yard to pluck
a few handfuls. She thought with
dread of the solitary walk and the horrible
ghouls, but her will was as strong
as her trust in God.</p>

<p>Elise went, but the king and the archbishop
followed her; they saw her disappear
within the grated gateway of
the church-yard. When they followed
they saw the ghouls sitting on the gravestone
as Elise had see them before; and
the king turned away his head because
he thought she was among them&mdash;she,
whose head this very evening had rested
on his breast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
&ldquo;The people must judge her,&rdquo; he
groaned, and the people judged. &ldquo;Let
her be consumed in the glowing flames!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was led away from her beautiful
royal apartments to a dark, damp dungeon,
where the wind whistled through
the grated window. Instead of velvet
and silk, they gave her the bundle of
nettles she had gathered to lay her
head upon. The hard, burning shirts of
mail were to be her covering, but they
could have given her nothing more
precious.</p>

<p>She set to work again, with many
prayers to God. Outside her prison the
street boys sang derisive songs about
her, and not a soul comforted her with
a kind word.</p>

<p>Towards evening she heard the rustle
of swans&rsquo; wings close to her window; it
was her youngest brother; at last he
had found her. He sobbed aloud with
joy, although he knew that the coming
night might be her last; but then her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
work was almost done, and her brothers
were there.</p>

<p>The archbishop came to spend his last
hours with her, as he had promised the
king. She shook her head at him, and
by looks and gestures begged him to
leave her. She had only this night in
which to finish her work, or else all would
be wasted, all&mdash;her pain, tears, and
sleepless nights. The archbishop went
away with bitter words against her, but
poor Elise knew that she was innocent,
and she went on with her work.</p>

<p>The little mice ran about the floor
bringing nettles to her feet, so as to give
what help they could, and a thrush sat
on the grating of the window where he
sang all night as merrily as he could to
keep up her courage.</p>

<p>It was still only dawn and the sun
would not rise for an hour when the
eleven brothers stood at the gate of the
palace, begging to be taken to the king.
This could not be done was the answer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
for it was still night; the king was asleep,
and no one dared wake him. All their
entreaties and threats were useless; the
watch turned out, and even the king himself
came to see what was the matter;
but just then the sun rose, and no more
brothers were to be seen&mdash;only eleven
wild swans hovering over the palace.</p>

<p>The whole populace streamed out of
the town gates; they were all anxious
to see the witch burned. A miserable
horse drew the cart in which Elise was
seated. They had put upon her a
smock of green sacking, and all her
beautiful long hair hung loose from the
lovely head. Her cheeks were deathly
pale, and her lips moved softly, while
her fingers unceasingly twisted the
green yarn. Even on the way to her
death she could not abandon her unfinished
work. Ten shirts lay completed
at her feet; she labored away at
the eleventh amid the scoffing insults
of the populace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
&ldquo;Look at the witch; how she mutters!
She has never a book of psalms in her
hands; no, there she sits with her loathsome
sorcery. Tear it away from her
into a thousand bits!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crowd pressed around her to destroy
her work, but just then eleven
white swans flew down and perched
upon the cart flapping their wings.
The crowd gave way before them in
terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a sign from Heaven! She is
innocent!&rdquo; they whispered, but they
dared not say it aloud.</p>

<p>The executioner seized her by the
hand. But she hastily threw the eleven
shirts over the swans, who were immediately
transformed to eleven handsome
princes; but the youngest had a
swan&rsquo;s wing in place of an arm, for one
sleeve was wanting to his shirt of mail;
she had not been able to finish it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I may speak! I am innocent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The populace who saw what had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
happened bowed down before her as if she
had been a saint, but she sank lifeless
in her brother&rsquo;s arms, so great had been
the strain, the terror, and the suffering
she had endured.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, innocent she is indeed,&rdquo; said
the eldest brother, and he told them all
that had happened.</p>

<p>While he spoke a wonderful fragrance
spread around as of millions of roses.
Every fagot in the pile had taken root
and shot out branches, and a great high
hedge of red roses had arisen. At the
very top was one pure white blossom;
it shone like a star, and the king broke
it off and laid it on Elise&rsquo;s bosom, and
she woke with joy and peace in her
heart.</p>

<p>All the church bells began to ring of
their own accord, and the singing birds
flocked around them. Surely such a
bridal procession went back to the
palace as no king had ever seen before!</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE once lived a poor tailor who
had a son called Aladdin, a careless,
idle boy who would do nothing
but play all day long in the streets with
little idle boys like himself. This so
grieved the father that he died; yet, in
spite of his mother&rsquo;s tears and prayers,
Aladdin did not mend his ways. One
day, when he was playing in the streets
as usual, a stranger asked him his age,
and if he was not the son of Mustapha
the tailor. &ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; replied Aladdin;
&ldquo;but he died a long while ago.&rdquo;
On this the stranger, who was a famous
African magician, fell on his neck and
kissed him, saying: &ldquo;I am your uncle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
and knew you from your likeness to my
brother. Go to your mother and tell
her I am coming.&rdquo; Aladdin ran home
and told his mother of his newly found
uncle. &ldquo;Indeed, child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;your
father had a brother, but I always
thought he was dead.&rdquo; However, she
prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek
his uncle, who came laden with wine
and fruit. He presently fell down and
kissed the place where Mustapha used
to sit, bidding Aladdin&rsquo;s mother not to
be surprised at not having seen him
before, as he had been forty years out
of the country. He then turned to
Aladdin, and asked him his trade, at
which the boy hung his head, while his
mother burst into tears. On learning
that Aladdin was idle and would learn
no trade, he offered to take a shop for
him and stock it with merchandise.
Next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit
of clothes and took him all over the city,
showing him the sights, and brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
him home at nightfall to his mother,
who was overjoyed to see her son so
fine.</p>

<p>Next day the magician led Aladdin
into some beautiful gardens a long way
outside the city gates. They sat down
by a fountain, and the magician pulled
a cake from his girdle which he divided
between them. They then journeyed
onward till they almost reached the
mountains. Aladdin was so tired that
he begged to go back, but the magician
beguiled him with pleasant stories, and
led him on in spite of himself. At last
they came to two mountains divided by
a narrow valley. &ldquo;We will go no farther,&rdquo;
said the false uncle. &ldquo;I will show
you something wonderful; only do you
gather up sticks while I kindle a fire.&rdquo;
When it was lit the magician threw on
it a powder he had about him, at the
same time saying some magical words.
The earth trembled a little and opened
in front of them, disclosing a square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
flat stone with a brass ring in the middle
to raise it by. Aladdin tried to run
away, but the magician caught him and
gave him a blow that knocked him
down. &ldquo;What have I done, uncle?&rdquo;
he said, piteously; whereupon the magician
said more kindly: &ldquo;Fear nothing,
but obey me. Beneath this stone lies
a treasure which is to be yours, and no
one else may touch it, so you must do
exactly as I tell you.&rdquo; At the word
&ldquo;treasure&rdquo; Aladdin forgot his fears, and
grasped the ring as he was told, saying
the names of his father and grandfather.
The stone came up quite easily, and
some steps appeared. &ldquo;Go down,&rdquo;
said the magician; &ldquo;at the foot of those
steps you will find an open door leading
into three large halls. Tuck up your
gown and go through them without
touching anything, or you will die instantly.
These halls lead into a garden
of fine fruit trees. Walk on till you
come to a niche in a terrace where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
stands a lighted lamp. Pour out the
oil it contains, and bring it me.&rdquo; He
drew a ring from his finger and gave it
to Aladdin, bidding him prosper.</p>

<p>Aladdin found everything as the
magician had said, gathered some fruit
off the trees, and, having got the lamp,
arrived at the mouth of the cave. The
magician cried out in a great hurry:
&ldquo;Make haste and give me the lamp.&rdquo;
This Aladdin refused to do until he was
out of the cave. The magician flew
into a terrible passion, and throwing
some more powder onto the fire, he said
something, and the stone rolled back
into its place.</p>

<p>The magician left Persia forever,
which plainly showed that he was no
uncle of Aladdin&rsquo;s, but a cunning magician,
who had read in his magic books
of a wonderful lamp, which would make
him the most powerful man in the
world. Though he alone knew where
to find it, he could only receive it from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
the hand of another. He had picked
out the foolish Aladdin for this purpose,
intending to get the lamp and kill him
afterwards.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things&rdquo;</p>

<p>For two days Aladdin remained in
the dark, crying and lamenting. At
last he clasped his hands in prayer, and
in so doing rubbed the ring, which the
magician had forgotten to take from
him. Immediately an enormous and
frightful genie rose out of the earth,
saying: &ldquo;What wouldst thou with me?
I am the Slave of the Ring, and will
obey thee in all things.&rdquo; Aladdin fearlessly
replied: &ldquo;Deliver me from this
place!&rdquo; whereupon the earth opened,
and he found himself outside. As soon
as his eyes could bear the light he went
home, but fainted on the threshold.
When he came to himself he told his
mother what had passed, and showed
her the lamp and the fruits he had
gathered in the garden, which were in
reality precious stones. He then asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
for some food. &ldquo;Alas! child,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I have nothing in the house, but I
have spun a little cotton and will go
and sell it.&rdquo; Aladdin bade her keep
her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
instead. As it was very dirty she began
to rub it, that it might fetch a higher
price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared,
and asked what she would have.
She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching
the lamp, said boldly: &ldquo;Fetch me something
to eat!&rdquo; The genie returned with
a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing
rich meats, two silver cups, and
two bottles of wine. Aladdin&rsquo;s mother,
when she came to herself, said: &ldquo;Whence
comes this splendid feast?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask not,
but eat,&rdquo; replied Aladdin. So they sat
at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and
Aladdin told his mother about the lamp.
She begged him to sell it, and have nothing
to do with devils. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said
Aladdin, &ldquo;since chance hath made us
aware of its virtues, we will use it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
the ring likewise, which I shall always
wear on my finger.&rdquo; When they had
eaten all the genie had brought Aladdin
sold one of the silver plates, and so on
until none were left. He then had recourse
to the genie, who gave him another
set of plates, and thus they lived
for many years.</p>

<p>One day Aladdin heard an order from
the Sultan proclaimed that every one
was to stay at home and close his shutters
while the Princess, his daughter,
went to and from the bath. Aladdin was
seized by a desire to see her face, which
was very difficult, as she always went
veiled. He hid himself behind the door
of the bath and peeped through a chink.
The Princess lifted her veil as she went
in, and looked so beautiful that Aladdin
fell in love with her at first sight. He
went home so changed that his mother
was frightened. He told her he loved
the Princess so deeply that he could not
live without her, and meant to ask her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
in marriage of her father. His mother,
on hearing this, burst out laughing, but
Aladdin at last prevailed upon her to
go before the Sultan and carry his request.
She fetched a napkin and laid
in it the magic fruits from the enchanted
garden, which sparkled and shone like
the most beautiful jewels. She took
these with her to please the Sultan, and
set out, trusting in the lamp. The
Grand Vizier and the lords of council
had just gone in as she entered the hall
and placed herself in front of the Sultan.
He, however, took no notice of her.
She went every day for a week, and
stood in the same place. When the
council broke up on the sixth day the
Sultan said to his Vizier: &ldquo;I see a certain
woman in the audience-chamber
every day carrying something in a napkin.
Call her next time, that I may
find out what she wants.&rdquo; Next day,
at a sign from the Vizier, she went up
to the foot of the throne and remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
kneeling till the Sultan said to her:
&ldquo;Rise, good woman, and tell me what
you want.&rdquo; She hesitated, so the Sultan
sent away all but the Vizier, and
bade her speak freely, promising to forgive
her beforehand for anything she
might say. She then told him of her
son&rsquo;s violent love for the Princess. &ldquo;I
prayed him to forget her,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but in vain; he threatened to do some
desperate deed if I refused to go and
ask your Majesty for the hand of the
Princess. Now I pray you to forgive
not me alone, but my son Aladdin.&rdquo;
The Sultan asked her kindly what she
had in the napkin, whereupon she unfolded
the jewels and presented them.
He was thunderstruck, and turning to
the Vizier said: &ldquo;What sayest thou?
Ought I not to bestow the Princess on
one who values her at such a price?&rdquo;
The Vizier, who wanted her for his own
son, begged the Sultan to withhold her
for three months, in the course of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
he hoped his son would contrive to
make him a richer present. The Sultan
granted this, and told Aladdin&rsquo;s mother
that, though he consented to the marriage,
she must not appear before him
again for three months.</p>

<p>Aladdin waited patiently for nearly
three months, but after two had elapsed
his mother, going into the city to buy
oil, found every one rejoicing, and asked
what was going on. &ldquo;Do you not
know,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;that the son
of the Grand Vizier is to marry the
Sultan&rsquo;s daughter to-night?&rdquo; Breathless,
she ran and told Aladdin, who was
overwhelmed at first, but presently bethought
him of the lamp. He rubbed
it, and the genie appeared, saying:
&ldquo;What is thy will?&rdquo; Aladdin replied:
&ldquo;The Sultan, as thou knowest, has broken
his promise to me, and the Vizier&rsquo;s
son is to have the Princess. My command
is that to-night you bring hither
the bride and bridegroom.&rdquo; &ldquo;Master,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
I obey,&rdquo; said the genie. Aladdin then
went to his chamber, where, sure enough,
at midnight the genie transported the
bed containing the Vizier&rsquo;s son and the
Princess. &ldquo;Take this new-married man,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;and put him outside in the
cold, and return at daybreak.&rdquo; Whereupon
the genie took the Vizier&rsquo;s son out
of bed, leaving Aladdin with the Princess.
&ldquo;Fear nothing,&rdquo; Aladdin said to
her; &ldquo;you are my wife, promised to me
by your unjust father, and no harm
shall come to you.&rdquo; The Princess was
too frightened to speak, and passed the
most miserable night of her life, while
Aladdin lay down beside her and slept
soundly. At the appointed hour the
genie fetched in the shivering bridegroom,
laid him in his place, and transported
the bed back to the palace.</p>

<p>Presently the Sultan came to wish
his daughter good-morning. The unhappy
Vizier&rsquo;s son jumped up and hid
himself, while the Princess would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
say a word, and was very sorrowful.
The Sultan sent her mother to her, who
said: &ldquo;How comes it, child, that you
will not speak to your father? What
has happened?&rdquo; The Princess sighed
deeply, and at last told her mother how,
during the night, the bed had been carried
into some strange house, and what
had passed there. Her mother did
not believe her in the least, but bade
her rise and consider it an idle
dream.</p>

<p>The following night exactly the same
thing happened, and next morning, on
the Princess&rsquo;s refusing to speak, the
Sultan threatened to cut off her head.
She then confessed all, bidding him ask
the Vizier&rsquo;s son if it were not so. The
Sultan told the Vizier to ask his son,
who owned the truth, adding that, dearly
as he loved the Princess, he had
rather die than go through another
such fearful night, and wished to be
separated from her. His wish was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
granted, and there was an end of feasting
and rejoicing.</p>

<p>When the three months were over,
Aladdin sent his mother to remind the
Sultan of his promise. She stood in the
same place as before, and the Sultan,
who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered
him, and sent for her. On
seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less
inclined than ever to keep his word,
and asked his Vizier&rsquo;s advice, who counselled
him to set so high a value on the
Princess that no man living could come
up to it. The Sultan then turned to
Aladdin&rsquo;s mother, saying: &ldquo;Good woman,
a sultan must remember his promises,
and I will remember mine, but
your son must first send me forty basins
of gold brimful of jewels, carried by
forty black slaves, led by as many white
ones, splendidly dressed. Tell him that
I await his answer.&rdquo; The mother of
Aladdin bowed low and went home,
thinking all was lost. She gave Aladdin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
the message, adding: &ldquo;He may
wait long enough for your answer!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not so long, mother, as you think,&rdquo;
her son replied. &ldquo;I would do a great
deal more than that for the Princess.&rdquo;
He summoned the genie, and in a few
moments the eighty slaves arrived, and
filled up the small house and garden.
Aladdin made them set out to the palace
two and two, followed by his mother.
They were so richly dressed, with such
splendid jewels in their girdles, that
every one crowded to see them and the
basins of gold they carried on their
heads. They entered the palace, and,
after kneeling before the Sultan, stood
in a half-circle round the throne with
their arms crossed, while Aladdin&rsquo;s
mother presented them to the Sultan.
He hesitated no longer, but said: &ldquo;Good
woman, return and tell your son that I
wait for him with open arms.&rdquo; She
lost no time in telling Aladdin, bidding
him make haste. But Aladdin first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
called the genie. &ldquo;I want a scented
bath,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a richly embroidered
habit, a horse surpassing the Sultan&rsquo;s,
and twenty slaves to attend me. Besides
this, six slaves, beautifully dressed,
to wait on my mother; and lastly, ten
thousand pieces of gold in ten purses.&rdquo;
No sooner said than done, Aladdin
mounted his horse and passed through
the streets, the slaves strewing gold as
they went. Those who had played with
him in his childhood knew him not, he
had grown so handsome. When the
Sultan saw him he came down from his
throne, embraced him, and led him into
a hall where a feast was spread, intending
to marry him to the Princess that
very day. But Aladdin refused, saying:
&ldquo;I must build a palace fit for her,&rdquo;
and took his leave. Once home, he
said to the genie: &ldquo;Build me a palace
of the finest marble, set with jasper,
agate, and other precious stones. In the
middle you shall build me a large hall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
with a dome, its four walls of massy
gold and silver, each side having six
windows, whose lattices, all except one
which is to be unfinished, must be set
with diamonds and rubies. There must
be stables and horses and grooms and
slaves; go and see about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The palace was finished by next day,
and the genie carried him there and
showed him all his orders faithfully carried
out, even to the laying of a velvet
carpet from Aladdin&rsquo;s palace to the
Sultan&rsquo;s. Aladdin&rsquo;s mother then dressed
herself carefully, and walked to the
palace with her slaves, while he followed
her on horseback. The Sultan sent
musicians with trumpets and cymbals
to meet them, so that the air resounded
with music and cheers. She was taken
to the Princess, who saluted her and
treated her with great honor. At night
the Princess said good-bye to her father,
and set out on the carpet for Aladdin&rsquo;s
palace, with his mother at her side, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
followed by the hundred slaves. She
was charmed at the sight of Aladdin,
who ran to receive her. &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;blame your beauty for my boldness
if I have displeased you.&rdquo; She
told him that, having seen him, she willingly
obeyed her father in this matter.
After the wedding had taken place
Aladdin led her into the hall, where a
feast was spread, and she supped with
him, after which they danced till midnight.</p>

<p>Next day Aladdin invited the Sultan
to see the palace. On entering the hall
with the four-and-twenty windows, with
their rubies, diamonds, and emeralds,
he cried: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a world&rsquo;s wonder! There
is only one thing that surprises me.
Was it by accident that one window was
left unfinished?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, sir, by design,&rdquo;
returned Aladdin. &ldquo;I wished your
Majesty to have the glory of finishing
this palace.&rdquo; The Sultan was pleased,
and sent for the best jewellers in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
city. He showed them the unfinished
window, and bade them fit it up like
the others. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied their spokesman,
&ldquo;we cannot find jewels enough.&rdquo;
The Sultan had his own fetched, which
they soon used, but to no purpose, for
in a month&rsquo;s time the work was not half
done. Aladdin, knowing that their task
was vain, bade them undo their work
and carry the jewels back, and the genie
finished the window at his command.
The Sultan was surprised to receive his
jewels again, and visited Aladdin, who
showed him the window finished. The
Sultan embraced him, the envious
Vizier meanwhile hinting that it was the
work of enchantment.</p>

<p>Aladdin had won the hearts of the
people by his gentle bearing. He was
made captain of the Sultan&rsquo;s armies,
and won several battles for him, but
remained modest and courteous as before,
and lived thus in peace and content
for several years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
But far away in Africa the magician
remembered Aladdin, and by his magic
arts discovered that Aladdin, instead of
perishing miserably in the cave, had
escaped, and had married a princess,
with whom he was living in great honor
and wealth. He knew that the poor
tailor&rsquo;s son could only have accomplished
this by means of the lamp, and
travelled night and day till he reached
the capital of China, bent on Aladdin&rsquo;s
ruin. As he passed through the town
he heard people talking everywhere
about a marvellous palace. &ldquo;Forgive
my ignorance,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what is this
palace you speak of?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have you not
heard of Prince Aladdin&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; was
the reply, &ldquo;the greatest wonder of the
world? I will direct you if you have
a mind to see it.&rdquo; The magician thanked
him who spoke, and having seen the
palace knew that it had been raised by
the Genie of the Lamp, and became
half mad with rage. He determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
to get hold of the lamp, and again plunge
Aladdin into the deepest poverty.</p>

<p>Unluckily, Aladdin had gone a-hunting
for eight days, which gave the
magician plenty of time. He bought a
dozen copper lamps, put them into a
basket, and went to the palace, crying:
&ldquo;New lamps for old!&rdquo; followed by a
jeering crowd. The Princess, sitting
in the hall of four-and-twenty windows,
sent a slave to find out what the noise
was about, who came back laughing,
so that the Princess scolded her. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;
replied the slave, &ldquo;who can help
laughing to see an old fool offering to
exchange fine new lamps for old ones?&rdquo;
Another slave, hearing this, said, &ldquo;There
is an old one on the cornice there which
he can have.&rdquo; Now this was the magic
lamp, which Aladdin had left there, as
he could not take it out hunting with
him. The Princess, not knowing its
value, laughingly bade the slave take
it and make the exchange. She went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
and said to the magician: &ldquo;Give me a
new lamp for this.&rdquo; He snatched it
and bade the slave take her choice,
amid the jeers of the crowd. Little he
cared, but left off crying his lamps, and
went out of the city gates to a lonely
place, where he remained till nightfall,
when he pulled out the lamp and rubbed
it. The genie appeared, and at the
magician&rsquo;s command carried him, together
with the palace and the Princess
in it, to a lonely place in Africa.</p>

<p>Next morning the Sultan looked out
of the window towards Aladdin&rsquo;s palace
and rubbed his eyes, for it was gone.
He sent for the Vizier and asked what
had become of the palace. The Vizier
looked out, too, and was lost in astonishment.
He again put it down to enchantment,
and this time the Sultan
believed him, and sent thirty men on
horseback to fetch Aladdin in chains.
They met him riding home, bound him,
and forced him to go with them on foot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
The people, however, who loved him,
followed, armed, to see that he came to
no harm. He was carried before the
Sultan, who ordered the executioner to
cut off his head. The executioner made
Aladdin kneel down, bandaged his eyes,
and raised his scimitar to strike. At
that instant the Vizier, who saw that
the crowd had forced their way into the
court-yard and were scaling the walls to
rescue Aladdin, called to the executioner
to stay his hand. The people,
indeed, looked so threatening that the
Sultan gave way and ordered Aladdin
to be unbound, and pardoned him in the
sight of the crowd. Aladdin now begged
to know what he had done. &ldquo;False
wretch!&rdquo; said the Sultan, &ldquo;come hither,&rdquo;
and showed him from the window the
place where his palace had stood.
Aladdin was so amazed that he could
not say a word. &ldquo;Where is my palace
and my daughter?&rdquo; demanded the
Sultan. &ldquo;For the first I am not so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
deeply concerned, but my daughter I
must have, and you must find her or
lose your head.&rdquo; Aladdin begged for
forty days in which to find her, promising
if he failed to return and suffer
death at the Sultan&rsquo;s pleasure. His
prayer was granted, and he went forth
sadly from the Sultan&rsquo;s presence. For
three days he wandered about like a
madman, asking every one what had become
of his palace, but they only laughed
and pitied him. He came to the
banks of a river, and knelt down to say
his prayers before throwing himself in.
In so doing he rubbed the magic ring he
still wore. The genie he had seen in the
cave appeared, and asked his will.
&ldquo;Save my life, genie,&rdquo; said Aladdin,
&ldquo;and bring my palace back.&rdquo; &ldquo;That
is not in my power,&rdquo; said the genie; &ldquo;I
am only the Slave of the Ring; you must
ask him of the lamp.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even so,&rdquo;
said Aladdin, &ldquo;but thou canst take me
to the palace, and set me down under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
my dear wife&rsquo;s window.&rdquo; He at once
found himself in Africa, under the window
of the Princess, and fell asleep out
of sheer weariness.</p>

<p>He was awakened by the singing of
the birds, and his heart was lighter.
He saw plainly that all his misfortunes
were owing to the loss of the lamp, and
vainly wondered who had robbed him
of it.</p>

<p>That morning the Princess rose earlier
than she had done since she had been
carried into Africa by the magician,
whose company she was forced to endure
once a day. She, however, treated
him so harshly that he dared not live
there altogether. As she was dressing,
one of her women looked out and saw
Aladdin. The Princess ran and opened
the window, and at the noise she made
Aladdin looked up. She called to him
to come to her, and great was the joy
of these lovers at seeing each other again.
After he had kissed her, Aladdin said: &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
beg of you, Princess, in God&rsquo;s name, before
we speak of anything else, for your
own sake and mine, tell me what has
become of an old lamp I left on the cornice
in the hall of four-and-twenty windows,
when I went a-hunting.&rdquo; &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;I am the innocent cause of
our sorrows,&rdquo; and told him of the exchange
of the lamp. &ldquo;Now I know,&rdquo;
cried Aladdin, &ldquo;that we have to thank
the African magician for this! Where
is the lamp?&rdquo; &ldquo;He carries it about
with him,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;I know,
for he pulled it out of his breast to show
me. He wishes me to break my faith
with you and marry him, saying that
you were beheaded by my father&rsquo;s command.
He is forever speaking ill of
you, but I only reply by my tears. If I
persist, I doubt not but he will use violence.&rdquo;
Aladdin comforted her, and
left her for a while. He changed clothes
with the first person he met in the town,
and having bought a certain powder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span>
returned to the Princess, who let him
in by a little side door. &ldquo;Put on your
most beautiful dress,&rdquo; he said to her,
&ldquo;and receive the magician with smiles,
leading him to believe that you have
forgotten me. Invite him to sup with
you, and say you wish to taste the wine
of his country. He will go for some
and while he is gone I will tell you what
to do.&rdquo; She listened carefully to Aladdin,
and when he left her arrayed herself
gayly for the first time since she
left China. She put on a girdle and
head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in
a glass that she was more beautiful than
ever, received the magician, saying, to
his great amazement: &ldquo;I have made up
my mind that Aladdin is dead, and that
all my tears will not bring him back to
me, so I am resolved to mourn no more,
and have therefore invited you to sup
with me; but I am tired of the wines of
China, and would fain taste those of
Africa.&rdquo; The magician flew to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
cellar, and the Princess put the powder
Aladdin had given her in her cup. When
he returned she asked him to drink her
health in the wine of Africa, handing
him her cup in exchange for his, as a
sign she was reconciled to him. Before
drinking the magician made her a speech
in praise of her beauty, but the Princess
cut him short, saying: &ldquo;Let us drink
first, and you shall say what you will
afterwards.&rdquo; She set her cup to her
lips and kept it there, while the magician
drained his to the dregs and fell back
lifeless. The Princess then opened the
door to Aladdin, and flung her arms
round his neck; but Aladdin put her
away, bidding her leave him, as he had
more to do. He then went to the dead
magician, took the lamp out of his vest,
and bade the genie carry the palace and
all in it back to China. This was done,
and the Princess in her chamber only
felt two little shocks, and little thought
she was at home again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
The Sultan, who was sitting in his
closet, mourning for his lost daughter,
happened to look up, and rubbed his
eyes, for there stood the palace as before.
He hastened thither, and Aladdin received
him in the hall of the four-and-twenty
windows, with the Princess at
his side. Aladdin told him what had
happened, and showed him the dead
body of the magician, that he might
believe. A ten days&rsquo; feast was proclaimed,
and it seemed as if Aladdin
might now live the rest of his life in
peace; but it was not to be.</p>

<p>The African magician had a younger
brother, who was, if possible, more wicked
and more cunning than himself. He
travelled to China to avenge his brother&rsquo;s
death, and went to visit a pious
woman called Fatima, thinking she
might be of use to him. He entered her
cell and clapped a dagger to her breast,
telling her to rise and do his bidding
on pain of death. He changed clothes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
with her, colored his face like hers, put
on her veil, and murdered her, that she
might tell no tales. Then he went towards
the palace of Aladdin, and all the
people, thinking he was the holy woman,
gathered round him, kissing his hands
and begging his blessing. When he got
to the palace there was such a noise
going on round him that the Princess
bade her slave look out of the window
and ask what was the matter. The
slave said it was the holy woman, curing
people by her touch of their ailments,
whereupon the Princess, who
had long desired to see Fatima, sent for
her. On coming to the Princess the
magician offered up a prayer for her
health and prosperity. When he had
done the Princess made him sit by her,
and begged him to stay with her always.
The false Fatima, who wished for nothing
better, consented, but kept his veil
down for fear of discovery. The Princess
showed him the hall, and asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
him what he thought of it. &ldquo;It is truly
beautiful,&rdquo; said the false Fatima. &ldquo;In
my mind it wants but one thing.&rdquo;
&ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; said the Princess.
&ldquo;If only a roc&rsquo;s egg,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;were
hung up from the middle of this dome,
it would be the wonder of the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this the Princess could think of
nothing but the roc&rsquo;s egg, and when
Aladdin returned from hunting he found
her in a very ill humor. He begged to
know what was amiss, and she told him
that all her pleasure in the hall was
spoiled for the want of a roc&rsquo;s egg hanging
from the dome. &ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo;
replied Aladdin, &ldquo;you shall soon be
happy.&rdquo; He left her and rubbed the
lamp, and when the genie appeared
commanded him to bring a roc&rsquo;s egg.
The genie gave such a loud and terrible
shriek that the hall shook. &ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;is it not enough that I have
done everything for you but you must
command me to bring my master and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
hang him up in the midst of this dome?
You and your wife and your palace deserve
to be burnt to ashes but that this
request does not come from you, but
from the brother of the African magician
whom you destroyed. He is now
in your palace disguised as the holy
woman&mdash;whom he murdered. He it
was who put that wish into your wife&rsquo;s
head. Take care of yourself, for he
means to kill you.&rdquo; So saying, the
genie disappeared.</p>

<p>Aladdin went back to the Princess,
saying his head ached, and requesting
that the holy Fatima should be fetched
to lay her hands on it. But when the
magician came near, Aladdin, seizing
his dagger, pierced him to the heart.
&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; cried the Princess.
&ldquo;You have killed the holy woman!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; replied Aladdin, &ldquo;but
a wicked magician,&rdquo; and told her of how
she had been deceived.</p>

<p>After this Aladdin and his wife lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
in peace. He succeeded the Sultan
when he died, and reigned for many
years, leaving behind him a long line
of kings.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N a town in Persia there dwelt two
brothers, one named Cassim, the other
Ali Baba. Cassim was married to a
rich wife and lived in plenty, while
Ali Baba had to maintain his wife and
children by cutting wood in a neighboring
forest and selling it in the town.
One day, when Ali Baba was in the
forest, he saw a troop of men on horseback
coming towards him in a cloud of
dust. He was afraid they were robbers,
and climbed into a tree for safety.
When they came up to him and dismounted,
he counted forty of them.
They unbridled their horses and tied
them to trees. The finest man among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
them, whom Ali Baba took to be their
captain, went a little way among some
bushes, and said: &ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> so
plainly that Ali Baba heard him. A
door opened in the rocks, and having
made the troop go in, he followed them,
and the door shut again of itself. They
stayed some time inside, and Ali Baba,
fearing they might come out and catch
him, was forced to sit patiently in the
tree. At last the door opened again,
and the Forty Thieves came out. As
the Captain went in last he came out
first, and made them all pass by him;
he then closed the door, saying: &ldquo;Shut,
Sesame!&rdquo; Every man bridled his horse
and mounted, the Captain put himself
at their head, and they returned as they
came.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
Sesame is a kind of grain.</p>
</div>

<p>Then Ali Baba climbed down and
went to the door concealed among the
bushes, and said: &ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
it flew open. Ali Baba, who expected a
dull, dismal place, was greatly surprised
to find it large and well lighted, and
hollowed by the hand of man in the
form of a vault, which received the light
from an opening in the ceiling. He saw
rich bales of merchandise&mdash;silk, stuff-brocades,
all piled together, and gold and
silver in heaps, and money in leather
purses. He went in and the door shut
behind him. He did not look at the
silver, but brought out as many bags
of gold as he thought his asses, which
were browsing outside, could carry,
loaded them with the bags, and hid it
all with fagots. Using the words:
&ldquo;Shut, Sesame!&rdquo; he closed the door and
went home.</p>

<p>Then he drove his asses into the yard,
shut the gates, carried the money-bags
to his wife, and emptied them out before
her. He bade her keep the secret,
and he would go and bury the gold.
&ldquo;Let me first measure it,&rdquo; said his wife.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
&ldquo;I will go borrow a measure of some one
while you dig the hole.&rdquo; So she ran to
the wife of Cassim and borrowed a measure.
Knowing Ali Baba&rsquo;s poverty, the
sister was curious to find out what sort
of grain his wife wished to measure,
and artfully put some suet at the bottom
of the measure. Ali Baba&rsquo;s wife
went home and set the measure on the
heap of gold, and filled it and emptied
it often, to her great content. She then
carried it back to her sister, without
noticing that a piece of gold was sticking
to it, which Cassim&rsquo;s wife perceived
directly her back was turned. She grew
very curious, and said to Cassim when
he came home: &ldquo;Cassim, your brother
is richer than you. He does not count
his money, he measures it.&rdquo; He begged
her to explain this riddle, which she
did by showing him the piece of money
and telling him where she found it.
Then Cassim grew so envious that he
could not sleep, and went to his brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
in the morning before sunrise. &ldquo;Ali
Baba,&rdquo; he said, showing him the gold
piece, &ldquo;you pretend to be poor and yet
you measure gold.&rdquo; By this Ali Baba
perceived that through his wife&rsquo;s folly
Cassim and his wife knew their secret,
so he confessed all and offered Cassim
a share. &ldquo;That I expect,&rdquo; said Cassim;
&ldquo;but I must know where to find the
treasure, otherwise I will discover all,
and you will lose all.&rdquo; Ali Baba, more
out of kindness than fear, told him of
the cave, and the very words to use.
Cassim left Ali Baba, meaning to be beforehand
with him and get the treasure
himself. He rose early next morning,
and set out with ten mules loaded with
great chests. He soon found the place,
and the door in the rock. He said:
&ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo; and the door opened
and shut behind him. He could have
feasted his eyes all day on the treasures,
but he now hastened to gather together
as much of it as possible; but when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
was ready to go he could not remember
what to say for thinking of his great
riches. Instead of &ldquo;Sesame,&rdquo; he said:
&ldquo;Open, Barley!&rdquo; and the door remained
fast. He named several different sorts of
grain, all but the right one, and the door
still stuck fast. He was so frightened
at the danger he was in that he had as
much forgotten the word as if he had
never heard it.</p>

<p>About noon the robbers returned to
their cave, and saw Cassim&rsquo;s mules
roving about with great chests on their
backs. This gave them the alarm; they
drew their sabres, and went to the door,
which opened on their Captain&rsquo;s saying:
&ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo; Cassim, who
had heard the trampling of their horses&rsquo;
feet, resolved to sell his life dearly, so
when the door opened he leaped out and
threw the Captain down. In vain,
however, for the robbers with their
sabres soon killed him. On entering the
cave they saw all the bags laid ready,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>295]</a></span>
and could not imagine how any one had
got in without knowing their secret.
They cut Cassim&rsquo;s body into four quarters,
and nailed them up inside the cave,
in order to frighten any one who should
venture in, and went away in search of
more treasure.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">Cassim forgets the magic word</p>

<p>As night drew on Cassim&rsquo;s wife grew
very uneasy, and ran to her brother-in-law,
and told him where her husband
had gone. Ali Baba did his best to
comfort her, and set out to the forest
in search of Cassim. The first thing
he saw on entering the cave was his
dead brother. Full of horror, he put
the body on one of his asses, and bags
of gold on the other two, and, covering
all with some fagots, returned home.
He drove the two asses laden with gold
into his own yard, and led the other
to Cassim&rsquo;s house. The door was opened
by the slave Morgiana, whom he knew
to be both brave and cunning. Unloading
the ass, he said to her: &ldquo;This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
the body of your master, who has been
murdered, but whom we must bury as
though he had died in his bed. I will
speak with you again, but now tell
your mistress I am come.&rdquo; The wife
of Cassim, on learning the fate of her
husband, broke out into cries and tears,
but Ali Baba offered to take her to
live with him and his wife if she would
promise to keep his counsel and leave
everything to Morgiana; whereupon she
agreed, and dried her eyes.</p>

<p>Morgiana, meanwhile, sought an
apothecary and asked him for some
lozenges. &ldquo;My poor master,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;can neither eat nor sleep, and no one
knows what his distemper is.&rdquo; She
carried home the lozenges and returned
next day weeping, and asked for an
essence only given to those just about
to die. Thus, in the evening, no one
was surprised to hear the wretched
shrieks and cries of Cassim&rsquo;s wife and
Morgiana telling every one that Cassim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
was dead. The day after, Morgiana went
to an old cobbler near the gates of the
town who opened his stall early, put a
piece of gold in his hand, and bade him
follow with his needle and thread.
Having bound his eyes with a handkerchief,
she took him to the room where
the body lay, pulled off the bandage, and
bade him sew the quarters together, after
which she covered his eyes again and
led him home. Then they buried Cassim,
and Morgiana his slave followed
him to the grave, weeping and tearing
her hair, while Cassim&rsquo;s wife stayed at
home uttering lamentable cries. Next
day she went to live with Ali Baba, who
gave Cassim&rsquo;s shop to his eldest son.</p>

<p>The Forty Thieves, on their return
to the cave, were much astonished to
find Cassim&rsquo;s body gone and some of
their money-bags. &ldquo;We are certainly
discovered,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;and
shall be undone if we cannot find out
who it is that knows our secret. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
men must have known it; we have killed
one, we must now find the other. To
this end one of you who is bold and artful
must go into the city dressed as a
traveller, and discover whom we have
killed, and whether men talk of the
strange manner of his death. If the
messenger fails he must lose his life, lest
we be betrayed.&rdquo; One of the thieves
started up and offered to do this, and
after the rest had highly commended
him for his bravery he disguised himself,
and happened to enter the town at
daybreak, just by Baba Mustapha&rsquo;s
stall. The thief bade him good-day,
saying: &ldquo;Honest man, how can you
possibly see to stitch at your age?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Old as I am,&rdquo; replied the cobbler, &ldquo;I
have very good eyes, and you will believe
me when I tell you that I sewed
a dead body together in a place where
I had less light than I have now.&rdquo; The
robber was overjoyed at his good-fortune,
and, giving him a piece of gold,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
desired to be shown the house where he
stitched up the dead body. At first
Mustapha refused, saying that he was
blindfolded; but when the robber gave
him another piece of gold he began to
think he might remember the turnings
if blindfolded as before. This means
succeeded; the robber partly led him,
and was partly guided by him, right in
front of Cassim&rsquo;s house, the door of
which the robber marked with a piece
of chalk. Then, well pleased, he bade
farewell to Baba Mustapha and returned
to the forest. By and by Morgiana,
going out, saw the mark the robber
had made, quickly guessed that some
mischief was brewing, and, fetching a
piece of chalk, marked two or three
doors on each side, without saying anything
to her master or mistress.</p>

<p>The thief, meantime, told his comrades
of his discovery. The Captain
thanked him, and bade him show him
the house he had marked. But when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
they came to it they saw that five or
six of the houses were chalked in the
same manner. The guide was so confounded
that he knew not what answer
to make, and when they returned he
was at once beheaded for having failed.
Another robber was despatched, and,
having won over Baba Mustapha, marked
the house in red chalk; but Morgiana
being again too clever for them, the
second messenger was put to death also.
The Captain now resolved to go himself,
but, wiser than the others, he did
not mark the house, but looked at it so
closely that he could not fail to remember
it. He returned, and ordered his
men to go into the neighboring villages
and buy nineteen mules, and thirty-eight
leather jars, all empty, except one
which was full of oil. The Captain put
one of his men, fully armed, into each,
rubbing the outside of the jars with oil
from the full vessel. Then the nineteen
mules were loaded with thirty-seven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
robbers in jars, and the jar of oil, and
reached the town by dusk. The Captain
stopped his mules in front of Ali
Baba&rsquo;s house, and said to Ali Baba, who
was sitting outside for coolness: &ldquo;I have
brought some oil from a distance to sell
at to-morrow&rsquo;s market, but it is now so
late that I know not where to pass the
night, unless you will do me the favor
to take me in.&rdquo; Though Ali Baba had
seen the Captain of the robbers in the
forest, he did not recognize him in the
disguise of an oil merchant. He bade
him welcome, opened his gates for the
mules to enter, and went to Morgiana
to bid her prepare a bed and supper
for his guest. He brought the stranger
into his hall, and after they had supped
went again to speak to Morgiana in the
kitchen, while the Captain went into
the yard under pretence of seeing after
his mules, but really to tell his men what
to do. Beginning at the first jar and
ending at the last, he said to each man:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
&ldquo;As soon as I throw some stones from
the window of the chamber where I lie,
cut the jars open with your knives and
come out, and I will be with you in a
trice.&rdquo; He returned to the house, and
Morgiana led him to his chamber. She
then told Abdallah, her fellow-slave, to
set on the pot to make some broth for
her master, who had gone to bed. Meanwhile
her lamp went out, and she had
no more oil in the house. &ldquo;Do not be
uneasy,&rdquo; said Abdallah; &ldquo;go into the
yard and take some out of one of those
jars.&rdquo; Morgiana thanked him for his
advice, took the oil-pot, and went into
the yard. When she came to the first
jar the robber inside said softly: &ldquo;Is it
time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any other slave but Morgiana, on
finding a man in the jar instead of the
oil she wanted, would have screamed,
and made a noise; but she, knowing the
danger her master was in, bethought
herself of a plan, and answered quietly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>303]</a></span>
&ldquo;Not yet, but presently.&rdquo; She went to
all the jars, giving the same answer,
till she came to the jar of oil. She now
saw that her master, thinking to entertain
an oil merchant, had let thirty-eight
robbers into his house. She filled
her oil-pot, went back to the kitchen,
and, having lit her lamp, went again to
the oil-jar and filled a large kettle full
of oil. When it boiled she went and
poured enough oil into every jar to
stifle and kill the robber inside. When
this brave deed was done she went back
to the kitchen, put out the fire and the
lamp, and waited to see what would
happen.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the Captain of
the robbers awoke, got up, and opened
the window. As all seemed quiet, he
threw down some little pebbles which hit
the jars. He listened, and as none of
his men seemed to stir he grew uneasy,
and went down into the yard. On going
to the first jar and saying, &ldquo;Are you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>304]</a></span>
asleep?&rdquo; he smelled the hot boiled oil,
and knew at once that his plot to murder
Ali Baba and his household had
been discovered. He found all the
gang were dead, and, missing the oil out
of the last jar, became aware of the manner
of their death. He then forced the
lock of a door leading into a garden, and
climbing over several walls made his
escape. Morgiana heard and saw all
this, and, rejoicing at her success, went
to bed and fell asleep.</p>

<p>At daybreak Ali Baba arose, and,
seeing the oil-jars there still, asked why
the merchant had not gone with his
mules. Morgiana bade him look in the
first jar and see if there was any oil.
Seeing a man, he started back in terror.
&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said Morgiana; &ldquo;the
man cannot harm you: he is dead.&rdquo;
Ali Baba, when he had recovered somewhat
from his astonishment, asked what
had become of the merchant. &ldquo;Merchant!&rdquo;
said she, &ldquo;he is no more a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>305]</a></span>
merchant than I am!&rdquo; and she told him the
whole story, assuring him that it was a
plot of the robbers of the forest, of
whom only three were left, and that the
white-and-red chalk-marks had something
to do with it. Ali Baba at once
gave Morgiana her freedom, saying that
he owed her his life. They then buried
the bodies in Ali Baba&rsquo;s garden, while
the mules were sold in the market by
his slaves.</p>

<p>The Captain returned to his lonely
cave, which seemed frightful to him
without his lost companions, and firmly
resolved to avenge them by killing Ali
Baba. He dressed himself carefully,
and went into the town, where he took
lodgings in an inn. In the course of a
great many journeys to the forest he
carried away many rich stuffs and much
fine linen, and set up a shop opposite
that of Ali Baba&rsquo;s son. He called himself
Cogia Hassan, and as he was both
civil and well dressed he soon made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>306]</a></span>
friends with Ali Baba&rsquo;s son, and through
him with Ali Baba, whom he was continually
asking to sup with him. Ali
Baba, wishing to return his kindness,
invited him into his house and received
him smiling, thanking him for his kindness
to his son. When the merchant was
about to take his leave Ali Baba stopped
him, saying: &ldquo;Where are you going, sir,
in such haste? Will you not stay and
sup with me?&rdquo; The merchant refused,
saying that he had a reason; and on
Ali Baba&rsquo;s asking him what that was,
he replied: &ldquo;It is, sir, that I can eat
no victuals that have any salt in them.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said Ali Baba, &ldquo;let me
tell you that there shall be no salt in
either the meat or the bread that we eat
to-night.&rdquo; He went to give this order
to Morgiana, who was much surprised.
&ldquo;Who is this man,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who eats
no salt with his meat?&rdquo; &ldquo;He is an
honest man, Morgiana,&rdquo; returned her
master; &ldquo;therefore do as I bid you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>307]</a></span>
But she could not withstand a desire
to see this strange man, so she helped
Abdallah to carry up the dishes, and
saw in a moment that Cogia Hassan was
the robber Captain, and carried a dagger
under his garment. &ldquo;I am not surprised,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;that this
wicked man, who intends to kill my
master, will eat no salt with him; but
I will hinder his plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sent up the supper by Abdallah,
while she made ready for one of the
boldest acts that could be thought on.
When the dessert had been served,
Cogia Hassan was left alone with Ali
Baba and his son, whom he thought to
make drunk and then to murder them.
Morgiana, meanwhile, put on a head-dress
like a dancing-girl&rsquo;s, and clasped
a girdle round her waist, from which
hung a dagger with a silver hilt, and
said to Abdallah: &ldquo;Take your tabor,
and let us go and divert our master and
his guest.&rdquo; Abdallah took his tabor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>308]</a></span>
and played before Morgiana until they
came to the door, where Abdallah stopped
playing and Morgiana made a low
courtesy. &ldquo;Come in, Morgiana,&rdquo; said Ali
Baba, &ldquo;and let Cogia Hassan see what
you can do.&rdquo; And, turning to Cogia
Hassan, he said: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my slave and
my housekeeper.&rdquo; Cogia Hassan was
by no means pleased, for he feared that
his chance of killing Ali Baba was gone
for the present; but he pretended great
eagerness to see Morgiana, and Abdallah
began to play and Morgiana to dance.
After she had performed several dances,
she drew her dagger and made passes
with it, sometimes pointing it at her own
breast, sometimes at her master&rsquo;s, as
if it were part of the dance. Suddenly,
out of breath, she snatched the tabor
from Abdallah with her left hand, and,
holding the dagger in her right, held out
the tabor to her master. Ali Baba and
his son put a piece of gold into it,
and Cogia Hassan, seeing that she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>309]</a></span>
coming to him, pulled out his purse
to make her a present; but while he
was putting his hand into it, Morgiana
plunged the dagger into his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhappy girl!&rdquo; cried Ali Baba and
his son, &ldquo;what have you done to ruin
us?&rdquo; &ldquo;It was to preserve you, master,
not to ruin you,&rdquo; answered Morgiana.
&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; opening the false merchant&rsquo;s
garment and showing the dagger; &ldquo;see
what an enemy you have entertained!
Remember, he would eat no salt with
you, and what more would you have?
Look at him! he is both the false oil
merchant and the Captain of the Forty
Thieves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Baba was so grateful to Morgiana
for thus saving his life that he offered
her to his son in marriage, who readily
consented, and a few days after the
wedding was celebrated with great
splendor. At the end of a year Ali
Baba, hearing nothing of the two remaining
robbers, judged they were dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>310]</a></span>
and set out to the cave. The door opened
on his saying: &ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo; He
went in, and saw that nobody had been
there since the Captain left it. He
brought away as much gold as he could
carry, and returned to town. He told
his son the secret of the cave, which his
son handed down in his turn, so the
children and grandchildren of Ali Baba
were rich to the end of their lives.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND VOYAGE OF<br />
SINDBAD THE SAILOR</h2>
<br /><br /><br />
</td>

</table>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> DESIGNED, after my first voyage,
to spend the rest of my days at Bagdad,
but it was not long ere I grew
weary of an indolent life, and I put to
sea a second time, with merchants of
known probity. We embarked on board
a good ship, and after recommending
ourselves to God, set sail. We traded
from island to island, and exchanged
commodities with great profit. One
day we landed on an island covered with
several sorts of fruit trees, but we could
see neither man nor animal. We walked
in the meadows, along the streams
that watered them. Whilst some diverted
themselves with gathering flowers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>312]</a></span>
and others fruits, I took my wine and
provisions, and sat down near a stream
betwixt two high trees, which formed
a thick shade. I made a good meal,
and afterwards fell asleep. I cannot
tell how long I slept, but when I awoke
the ship was gone.</p>

<p>In this sad condition, I was ready to
die with grief. I cried out in agony,
beat my head and breast, and threw
myself upon the ground, where I lay
some time in despair. I upbraided myself
a hundred times for not being content
with the produce of my first voyage,
that might have sufficed me all my
life. But all this was in vain, and my
repentance came too late. At last I
resigned myself to the will of God. Not
knowing what to do, I climbed up to
the top of a lofty tree, from whence I
looked about on all sides, to see if I
could discover anything that could give
me hopes. When I gazed towards the
sea I could see nothing but sky and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>313]</a></span>
water; but looking over the land I beheld
something white; and coming down,
I took what provision I had left, and
went towards it, the distance being so
great that I could not distinguish what
it was.</p>

<p>As I approached, I thought it to be
a white dome, of a prodigious height
and extent; and when I came up to it,
I touched it, and found it to be very
smooth. I went round to see if it was
open on any side, but saw it was not,
and that there was no climbing up to
the top, as it was so smooth. It was at
least fifty paces round.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was about to set,
and all of a sudden the sky became as
dark as if it had been covered with a
thick cloud. I was much astonished
at this sudden darkness, but much more
when I found it occasioned by a bird of
a monstrous size, that came flying towards
me. I remembered that I had
often heard mariners speak of a miraculous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>314]</a></span>
bird called the roc, and conceived
that the great dome which I so much
admired must be its egg. In short, the
bird alighted, and sat over the egg. As
I perceived her coming I crept close to
the egg, so that I had before me one of
the legs of the bird, which was as big
as the trunk of a tree. I tied myself
strongly to it with my turban, in hopes
that the roc next morning would carry
me with her out of this desert island.
After having passed the night in this
condition, the bird flew away as soon as
it was daylight, and carried me so high
that I could not discern the earth; she
afterwards descended with so much
rapidity that I lost my senses. But
when I found myself on the ground I
speedily untied the knot, and had
scarcely done so when the roc, having
taken up a serpent of a monstrous
length in her bill, flew away.</p>

<p>The spot where it left me was encompassed
on all sides by mountains that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>315]</a></span>
seemed to reach above the clouds, and
so steep that there was no possibility of
getting out of the valley. This was a
new perplexity; so that when I compared
this place with the desert island
from which the roc had brought me, I
found that I had gained nothing by the
change.</p>

<p>As I walked through this valley I
perceived it was strewed with diamonds,
some of which were of a surprising bigness.
I took pleasure in looking upon
them; but shortly saw at a distance
such objects as greatly diminished my
satisfaction, and which I could not view
without terror&mdash;namely, a great number
of serpents, so monstrous that the least
of them was capable of swallowing an
elephant. They retired in the daytime
to their dens, where they hid themselves
from the roc, their enemy, and came out
only in the night.</p>

<p>I spent the day in walking about in
the valley, resting myself at times in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>316]</a></span>
such places as I thought most convenient.
When night came on I went
into a cave, where I thought I might
repose in safety. I secured the entrance,
which was low and narrow, with
a great stone, to preserve me from the
serpents, but not so far as to exclude
the light. I supped on part of my provisions,
but the serpents, which began
hissing round me, put me into such
extreme fear that I did not sleep. When
day appeared the serpents retired, and
I came out of the cave trembling.
I can justly say that I walked upon
diamonds without feeling any inclination
to touch them. At last I sat down,
and notwithstanding my apprehensions,
not having closed my eyes during the
night, fell asleep, after having eaten a
little more of my provisions. But I
had scarcely shut my eyes when something
that fell by me with a great noise
awaked me. This was a large piece of
raw meat; and at the same time I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>317]</a></span>
several others fall down from the rocks
in different places.</p>

<p>I had always regarded as fabulous
what I had heard sailors and others relate
of the valley of diamonds, and of
the stratagems employed by merchants
to obtain jewels from thence; but now
I found that they had stated nothing
but the truth. For the fact is that the
merchants come to the neighborhood
of this valley, when the eagles have
young ones, and throwing great joints of
meat into the valley, the diamonds,
upon whose points they fall, stick to
them; the eagles, which are stronger in
this country than anywhere else, pounce
with great force upon those pieces of
meat, and carry them to their nests on
the precipices of the rocks to feed their
young; the merchants at this time run
to their nests, disturb and drive off
the eagles by their shouts, and take
away the diamonds that stick to the
meat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>318]</a></span>
I perceived in this device the means
of my deliverance.</p>

<p>Having collected together the largest
diamonds I could find, and put them
into the leather bag in which I used to
carry my provisions, I took the largest
of the pieces of meat, tied it close round
me with the cloth of my turban, and
then laid myself upon the ground with
my face downward, the bag of diamonds
being made fast to my girdle.</p>

<p>I had scarcely placed myself in this
posture when one of the eagles, having
taken me up with the piece of meat to
which I was fastened, carried me to his
nest on the top of the mountain. The
merchants immediately began their
shouting to frighten the eagles; and
when they had obliged them to quit
their prey, one of them came to the nest
where I was. He was much alarmed
when he saw me; but, recovering himself,
instead of inquiring how I came
thither, began to quarrel with me, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>319]</a></span>
asked why I stole his goods. &ldquo;You
will treat me,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;with more
civility when you know me better.
Do not be uneasy; I have diamonds
enough for you and myself&mdash;more than
all the other merchants together. Whatever
they have they owe to chance;
but I selected for myself, in the bottom
of the valley, those which you see in
this bag.&rdquo; I had scarcely done speaking
when the other merchants came
crowding about us, much astonished to
see me; but they were much more surprised
when I told them my story.</p>

<img src="images/fft16.jpg" width="384" height="600"
alt="The merchants wave cloths and swords to scare the eagle from its nest" />
</div>

<p class="caption">The merchants began their shouting to frighten the eagles</p>

<p>They conducted me to their encampment,
and there, having opened my
bag, they were surprised at the largeness
of my diamonds, and confessed
that they had never seen any of such
size and perfection. I prayed the merchant
who owned the nest to which I
had been carried (for every merchant
had his own) to take as many for his
share as he pleased. He contented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>320]</a></span>
himself with one, and that, too, the least
of them; and when I pressed him to take
more, without fear of doing me any
injury, &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am very well
satisfied with this, which is valuable
enough to save me the trouble of making
any more voyages, and will raise as
great a fortune as I desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I spent the night with the merchants,
to whom I related my story a second
time, for the satisfaction of those who
had not heard it. I could not moderate
my joy when I found myself delivered
from the danger I have mentioned. I
thought myself in a dream, and could
scarcely believe myself out of danger.</p>

<p>The merchants had thrown their
pieces of meat into the valley for several
days, and each of them being satisfied
with the diamonds that had fallen to
his lot, we left the place the next morning,
and travelled near high mountains,
where there were serpents of a prodigious
length, which we had the good-fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>321]</a></span>
to escape. We took shipping at
the first port we reached, and touched at
the isle of Roha, where the trees grow
that yield camphor. The tree is so
large, and its branches so thick, that
one hundred men may easily sit under
its shade. The juice, of which the
camphor is made, exudes from a hole
bored in the upper part of the tree, is
received in a vessel, where it thickens
to a consistency, and becomes what we
call camphor. After the juice is thus
drawn out, the tree withers and dies.</p>

<p>In this island is also found the rhinoceros,
an animal less than the elephant,
but larger than the buffalo. It has a
horn upon its nose, which is solid, and
cleft through the middle. The rhinoceros
fights with the elephant, runs his
horn into his belly, and carries him off
upon his head; but the blood and the
fat of the elephant running into his
eyes and making him blind, he falls to
the ground, and then, strange to relate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>322]</a></span>
the roc comes and carries them both
away in her claws, for food for her
young ones.</p>

<p>Here I exchanged some of my diamonds
for merchandise. From hence
we went to other islands, and at last,
having touched at several trading towns
of the continent, we landed at Bussorah,
from whence I proceeded to Bagdad.
There I immediately gave large presents
to the poor, and lived honorably
upon the vast riches I had brought, and
gained with so much fatigue.</p>

<h2>THE HISTORY OF<br />
ALI COGIA,<br />
A MERCHANT OF BAGDAD</h2>
<br /><br /><br />
</td>

</table>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the reign of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid
there lived at Bagdad a
merchant named Ali Cogia, who was
neither of the richest nor yet of the
lowest order. He dwelt in his paternal
house without either wife or children.
He lived contented with what his business
produced, and was as free in his
actions as in his will. During this period
he had for three successive nights a
dream, in which an old man appeared
to him, with a venerable aspect but a
severe countenance, who reprimanded
him for not having yet performed a
pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>

<p>This dream troubled Ali Cogia very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>324]</a></span>
much. As a good Mussulman, he was
aware of the necessity for this pilgrimage;
but as he was encumbered
with a house and furniture, and a shop,
he had always considered these as excuses,
and he endeavored to make up
for the neglect by charitable deeds.
But since he had these dreams his conscience
disturbed him, and he was so
fearful of some misfortune that he resolved
no longer to defer this act of
duty.</p>

<p>To enable himself to perform this in
the following year, Ali Cogia began to
sell his furniture; he then disposed of
his shop, together with the greatest
part of the merchandise, reserving only
such as might be salable at Mecca; and
he found a tenant for his house.</p>

<p>Having thus arranged everything, he
was ready to set out at the time that
the caravan for Mecca was to take its
departure. The only thing which remained
to be done was to find some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>325]</a></span>
secure place in which he could leave the
sum of a thousand pieces of gold, which
remained over and above the money he
had set apart for his pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Ali Cogia chose a jar of a proper size,
and put the thousand pieces of gold into
it, and then filled it up with olives.
After having closed the jar tightly, he
took it to a merchant who was his
friend. &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said he to him,
&ldquo;you are not unacquainted with my
intention of setting out on a pilgrimage
to Mecca with the caravan which goes
in a few days; I beg the favor of you to
take charge of this jar of olives till my
return.&rdquo; The merchant instantly replied:
&ldquo;Here, this is the key of my warehouse;
take the jar there yourself, and
place it where you think fit. I promise
you that you shall find it in the same
place when you come for it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day for departure arriving, Ali
Cogia joined the caravan with a camel
laden with the merchandise he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>326]</a></span>
made choice of, which also served him
as a sort of saddle to ride on, and he
arrived in perfect safety at Mecca. He,
together with the other pilgrims, visited
the temple&mdash;that edifice, so celebrated
and so frequented every year by all the
Mussulman nations, who repair thither
from all parts of the globe, to observe
the religious ceremonies which are required
of them. When he had acquitted
himself of the duties of his
pilgrimage, he exposed the merchandise
he had brought with him for
sale.</p>

<p>Two merchants, who were passing
that way, and saw the goods of Ali
Cogia, found them so beautiful that they
stopped to look at them, although they
did not want to purchase them. When
they had satisfied their curiosity, one
said to the other as he was walking
away: &ldquo;If this merchant knew the profit
he could make of his goods at Cairo, he
would take them there in preference to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>327]</a></span>
selling them here, where they are not
of so much value.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech did not escape Ali Cogia,
and as he had often heard of the beauties
of Egypt, he instantly resolved to travel
to that country. Having, therefore, packed
up his bales, he joined the caravan
that was going to Cairo. When he arrived
he found it so much to his advantage,
that in a few days he had disposed of
all his merchandise with much greater
profit than he could possibly
have expected. He then purchased
other goods, intending to go to Damascus,
and while he was waiting for the
convenience of a caravan, which was
to go in six weeks, he not only visited
everything that was worthy of his
curiosity in Cairo, but also went to
view the pyramids, extended his journey
to some distance up the Nile, and
inspected the most celebrated cities
that are situated on its banks.</p>

<p>As the caravan was passing through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>328]</a></span>
Jerusalem, Ali Cogia took the opportunity
to visit the temple, which is considered
by all Mussulmans as the most sacred after
that of Mecca, and from
which the place itself has obtained the
title of the Holy City. Ali Cogia found
the city of Damascus so delicious a spot,
from the abundance of its streams, its
meadows, and enchanting gardens, that
everything he had read of its delights,
in different accounts of the place, appeared
to be far below the truth, and
he was tempted to prolong his stay.
As, however, he did not forget that he
had to return to Bagdad, he at length
took his departure and went to Aleppo,
where he also passed some time, and
from thence, after having crossed the
Euphrates, he took the road to Moussoul,
intending to shorten his journey
by going down the Tigris.</p>

<p>But when Ali Cogia had reached
Moussoul, the Persian merchants with
whom he had travelled from Aleppo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>329]</a></span>
and had formed an intimacy, gained so
great an ascendancy over his mind by
their obliging manners and agreeable
conversation, that they had no difficulty
in persuading him to accompany them
to Shiraz, from whence it would be
easy for him to return to Bagdad, and
with considerable profit. They took
him through the cities of Sultania, Re&iuml;,
Coam, Kaschan, Ispahan, and then to
Shiraz, where he was induced to go with
them to India, and then return again
to Shiraz.</p>

<p>In this way, reckoning also the time
Ali Cogia resided in each city, it was now
nearly seven years since he had quitted
Bagdad, and he determined to return.
Till this period the friend to whom he
had intrusted the jar of olives before
he left that city had never thought more
of him or his jar. At the very time that
Ali Cogia was on his return with a caravan
from Shiraz, one evening as his
friend the merchant was at supper with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>330]</a></span>
his family, the conversation by accident
turned upon olives, and his wife expressed
a desire of eating some, adding
that it was a long time since any had
been produced in her house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you speak of olives,&rdquo; said the
merchant, &ldquo;you remind me that Ali
Cogia, when he went to Mecca seven
years since, left me a jar of them, which
he himself placed in my warehouse, that
he might find them there on his return.
But I know not what is become of Ali
Cogia. Some one, it is true, on the
return of the caravan, told me that he
was gone into Egypt. He must have
died there, as he has never returned in
the course of so many years; we may
surely eat the olives if they are still
good. Give me a dish and a light, and
I will go and get some, that we may
taste them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of God,&rdquo; replied the
wife, &ldquo;do not, my dear husband, commit
so disgraceful an action; you well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>331]</a></span>
know that nothing is so sacred as a trust
of this kind. You say that it is seven
years since Ali Cogia went to Mecca,
and he has never returned; but you
were informed he was gone into Egypt,
and how can you ascertain that he has
not gone still farther? It is enough that
you have received no intelligence of his
death; he may return to-morrow or the
day after to-morrow. Consider how
infamous it would be for you, as well as
your family, if he were to return, and
you could not restore the jar into his
hands in the same state as when he intrusted
it to your care. For my part, I
declare that I neither wish for any of
these olives, nor will eat any of them.
What I said was merely by way of conversation.
Besides, do you suppose
that, after so long a time, the olives can
be good? They must be spoiled. And
if Ali Cogia returns, as I have a foreboding
that he will, and he perceives
that you have opened the jar, what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>332]</a></span>
opinion will he form of your friendship
and integrity? I conjure you to abandon
your design.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This good woman argued at length,
because she saw, by her husband&rsquo;s
countenance, that he was resolved to
have his own way. In fact, he got up,
and, taking a light and a dish, went to
his warehouse. &ldquo;Remember at least,&rdquo;
said the wife, &ldquo;that I have no share in
what you are going to do; so do not attribute
any fault to me if you have
hereafter to repent of the action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant still persisted in his
purpose. When he had entered the
warehouse he opened the jar, and found
the olives all spoiled; but to see whether
those that were underneath were as
bad as the upper ones he poured some
out into the dish, and as he shook the
jar to make them fall out the easier
some pieces of gold fell out also. At the
sight of this money the merchant, who
was naturally avaricious, looked into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>333]</a></span>
jar, and perceived that he had emptied
almost all the olives into the dish, and
that what remained was money in pieces
of gold. He put the olives again into
the jar, and, covering it, left the warehouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke the truth, wife,&rdquo; said he,
when he returned. &ldquo;The olives are all
spoiled, and I have stopped up the jar
again, so that if Ali Cogia ever comes
back he will not discover that I have
touched it.&rdquo; &ldquo;You would have done
better to take my advice,&rdquo; returned the
wife, &ldquo;not to have meddled with it.
God grant that no evil may come of it.&rdquo;
The merchant paid as little attention to
these last words of his wife as he had
done to her former remonstrance. He
passed almost the whole night in devising
means to take possession of Ali
Cogia&rsquo;s money in such a way that he
might enjoy it in security should the
owner ever return and claim the jar.
The next morning, very early, he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>334]</a></span>
out to buy some olives of that year&rsquo;s
growth. He threw away those which
had been in Ali Cogia&rsquo;s jar, and, taking
out the gold, he put it in a place of
safety; then filling the jar with the fresh
olives he had just bought he put on the
same cover, and placed it in the same
spot where Ali Cogia had left it.</p>

<p>About a month after the merchant
had committed this treacherous act Ali
Cogia arrived at Bagdad, after his long
absence from that city. As he had
leased his house before his departure
he alighted at a khan, where he took a
lodging until he had informed his tenant
of his return, that the latter might procure
himself another residence.</p>

<p>The next day Ali Cogia went to see
his friend the merchant, who received
him with open arms, testifying the utmost
joy at seeing him again, after an
absence of so many years, which he said
almost made him despair of ever beholding
him any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>335]</a></span>
After the usual compliments, Ali
Cogia begged the merchant to return
him the jar of olives which he had left
in his care, at the same time apologizing
for having troubled him. &ldquo;My dear
friend,&rdquo; replied the merchant, &ldquo;do not
think of making excuses; your jar has
been no encumbrance to me, and I
should have done the same with you had
I been situated as you were. Here is the
key of my warehouse, go and take it; you
will find it where you put it yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Cogia went to the warehouse and
took out the jar, and having given the
key to the merchant, he thanked him
for the favor he had done him, and returned
to the khan where he lodged.
He opened the jar, and, thrusting his
hand to the depth where he supposed
the thousand pieces of gold might be,
he was extremely surprised at not feeling
them. He thought he must be deceived,
and to relieve his doubts he took
some of the dishes and other utensils of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>336]</a></span>
his travelling kitchen and emptied out
all the olives without finding one single
piece of money. He was motionless
with astonishment, and raising his eyes
and hands towards heaven, &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo;
he at length exclaimed, &ldquo;that
a man whom I considered as my friend
could be capable of so flagrant a breach
of trust?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Cogia, exceedingly alarmed at the
idea of so considerable a loss, returned
to the merchant. &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;do not be surprised that I
should return to you so quickly; I confess
that I knew the jar of olives which
I just now took out of your warehouse
to be mine; but I had put a thousand
pieces of gold in it with the olives, and
these I cannot find; perhaps you have
wanted them in your trade, and have
made use of them. If that be the case,
they are much at your service; I only
beg of you to relieve my fears, and give
me some acknowledgment for them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>337]</a></span>
after this you will return them to me
whenever it may be most convenient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchant, who expected Ali
Cogia to return to him, had prepared an
answer. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;when
you brought me the jar of olives, did I
touch it? Did I not give you the key
of my wareroom? Did you not deposit
it there yourself? and did you not find
it in the same place where you put it,
exactly in the same state, and covered
in the same manner? If you put money
in it, there you must find it. You told
me it contained olives, and I believed
you. This is all I know about the matter;
you may believe me or not as you
please, but I assure you I have not
touched it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Cogia used the gentlest means to
enable the merchant to justify himself.
&ldquo;I love peaceable measures,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and I should be sorry to proceed to
extremities, which would not be very
creditable to you in the eyes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>338]</a></span>
world. Consider that merchants, such
as we are, should abandon all private
interests to preserve their reputation.
Once more I tell you that I should be
sorry if your obstinacy compels me to
apply to the forms allowed by justice,
for I have always preferred losing something
of my right to having recourse to
those means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ali Cogia,&rdquo; resumed the merchant,
&ldquo;you confess that you have deposited
a jar of olives with me, that you took
possession of it again, and that you
carried it away; and now you come to
demand of me a thousand pieces of gold.
Did you tell me they were contained in
the jar? I am even ignorant that there
were olives in it; you did not show them
to me! I am surprised that you did
not require pearls and diamonds rather
than money. Take my advice: go
home, and do not assemble a crowd
about my door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some people had already stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>339]</a></span>
before his shop; and these last words, pronounced
in an angry voice, not only
collected a larger number, but made
the neighboring merchants come out
of their shops to inquire the reason of
the dispute. When Ali Cogia had explained
to them the subject, the most
earnest in the cause asked the merchant
what reply he had to make.</p>

<p>The merchant owned that he had kept
the jar belonging to Ali Cogia in his
warehouse, but he denied having touched
it, and made oath that he only knew
that it contained olives because Ali
Cogia had told him so, and that he considered
them all as witnesses of the insulting
affront which had been offered
to him in his own house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have drawn the affront on
yourself,&rdquo; said Ali Cogia, taking him by
the arm; &ldquo;but since you behave so
wickedly, I cite you by the law of God.
Let us see if you will have the face to
say the same before the cadi.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>340]</a></span>
At this summons, which every true
Mussulman must obey, unless he rebels
against his religion, the merchant had
not the courage to offer any resistance.
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is the very
thing I wish; we shall see who is wrong,
you or I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Cogia conducted the merchant
before the tribunal of the cadi, where
he accused him of having stolen a
thousand pieces of gold which were deposited
in his care, relating the fact as
it took place. The cadi inquired if he
had any witnesses. He replied that
he had not taken this precaution, because
he supposed the person to whom
he had intrusted his money to be his
friend, and till now an honest man.</p>

<p>The merchant urged nothing more in
his defence than what he had already
said to Ali Cogia in the presence of his
neighbors, and he concluded by offering
to take his oath not only that it was
false that he had taken the thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>341]</a></span>
pieces of gold, but even that he had any
knowledge of their being in his possession.
The cadi accepted the oath,
after which he was dismissed as innocent.</p>

<p>Ali Cogia, extremely mortified to find
himself condemned to suffer so considerable
a loss, protested against the sentence,
and declared to the cadi that
he would lay his complaint before the
Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, who would
do him justice; but the cadi did not regard
this threat, and he considered it
merely as the effect of the resentment
natural to all who lose their cause, and
he thought he had performed his duty
by acquitting one who was accused
without any witnesses to prove the fact.</p>

<p>While the merchant was triumphing
in his success over Ali Cogia, and indulging
his joy at having made so good
a bargain of the thousand pieces of
gold, Ali Cogia went to draw up a petition.
And the next day, having chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>342]</a></span>
the time when the caliph should return
from midday prayers, he placed himself
in a street which led to the mosque,
and when he passed, held out his hand
with the petition. An officer to whom
this function belongs, who was walking
before the caliph, instantly left his place
and came to take it, that he might present
it to his master.</p>

<p>As Ali Cogia knew that it was the
usual custom of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid,
when he returned to his
palace, to examine with his own eyes
all the petitions that were presented to
him in this way, he therefore followed
the procession, went into the palace,
and waited till the officer who had
taken the petition should come out of
the apartment of the caliph. When
he made his appearance he told Ali
Cogia that the caliph had read his petition,
and appointed the following day
to give him an audience; and having
inquired of him where the merchant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>343]</a></span>
lived, he sent to give him notice to
attend the next day at the same time.</p>

alt="The caliph and two other men stand and listen to the group of children" />
</div>

<p class="caption">The caliph listening to the children&rsquo;s court</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day, the
caliph, with the grand vizier Giafar and
Mesrour, the chief of the eunuchs, all
three disguised in the same manner,
went to make his usual excursion into
the city, as it was his custom frequently
to do. In passing through a street the
caliph heard a noise. He hastened his
pace, and came to a door which opened
into a court, where ten or twelve children,
who had not gone to rest, were
playing by moonlight, as he perceived
by looking through a crevice.</p>

<p>The caliph, feeling some curiosity to
know what these children were playing
at, sat down on a stone bench, which
was placed very conveniently near the
door; and as he was looking at them
through the crevice he heard one of
the most lively and intelligent among
them say to the others: &ldquo;Let us play at
the cadi. I am the cadi. Bring before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>344]</a></span>
me Ali Cogia and the merchant who stole
the thousand pieces of gold from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words of the child reminded
the caliph of the petition which had
been presented to him that day, and
which he had read; he therefore redoubled
his attention to hear the result
of the trial.</p>

<p>As the affair between Ali Cogia and
the merchant was a new thing, and
much talked of in the city of Bagdad,
even among children, the rest of this
youthful party fully agreed to the proposal,
and each chose the character he
would perform. No one disputed the
part of the cadi with him who had
made choice of it; and when he had
taken his seat with all the pomp and
gravity of a cadi, another, personating
the officer who attends the tribunal,
presented two others to him, one of
whom he called Ali Cogia, and the next
the merchant against whom Ali Cogia
preferred his complaint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>345]</a></span>
The pretended cadi then addressed
the feigned Ali Cogia. &ldquo;Ali Cogia,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;what do you require of this
merchant?&rdquo; He who personated this
character then made a low bow, and
informed the cadi of the facts, and concluded
by beseeching him to be pleased
to interpose his authority to prevent his
sustaining so considerable a loss. The
feigned cadi, after having listened to
Ali Cogia, turned to the merchant, and
asked him why he did not return to Ali
Cogia the sum he demanded of him.
This young merchant made use of the
same arguments which the real one had
alleged before the cadi of Bagdad, and
also in the same manner asked him to
suffer him to swear that what he said
was the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; replied the pretended
cadi; &ldquo;before we come to swearing I
should like to see the jar of olives. Ali
Cogia,&rdquo; said he, addressing the boy who
acted this part, &ldquo;have you brought the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>346]</a></span>
jar with you?&rdquo; As the latter replied
that he had not, he desired him to go
and fetch it.</p>

<p>Ali Cogia disappeared for a few minutes,
and then returning, pretended to
bring a jar to the cadi, which he said
was the same that had been deposited
with the merchant, and was now returned
to him. Not to omit any of the
usual forms, the cadi asked the merchant
if he owned it to be the same jar,
and the merchant proving by his silence
that he could not deny it, he ordered it
to be opened. The feigned Ali Cogia
then made a motion as if he were taking
off the cover, and the cadi that of
looking into the jar. &ldquo;These are fine
olives; let me taste,&rdquo; said he. Then, pretending
to take one to taste, he added:
&ldquo;They are excellent. But,&rdquo; continued
he, &ldquo;I think that olives which have been
kept seven years would not be so good.
Order some olive merchants to be called,
and let them give their opinion.&rdquo; Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>347]</a></span>
boys were then presented to him. &ldquo;Are
you olive merchants?&rdquo; he inquired; to
which they having replied in the affirmative,
he added: &ldquo;Tell me, then, if you
know how long olives, that are prepared
by people who make it their business,
can be preserved good to eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the feigned merchants,
&ldquo;whatever care may be taken to preserve
them, they are worth nothing after
the third year; they lose both their
flavor and color, and are only fit to be
thrown away.&rdquo; &ldquo;If that be the case,&rdquo;
resumed the young cadi, &ldquo;look at this
jar, and tell me how long the olives have
been kept that are in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The feigned merchants then pretended
to examine and taste the olives, and
told the cadi that they were fresh and
good. &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; replied
the cadi; &ldquo;here is Ali Cogia, who says
that he put them into the jar seven years
ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the merchants, &ldquo;we
can assure you that these olives are of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>348]</a></span>
this year&rsquo;s growth, and we will maintain
that there is not a single merchant
in Bagdad who will not be of the same
way of thinking.&rdquo; The accused merchant
was going to protest against this
testimony of the others, but the cadi
did not allow him time. &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;thou art a thief, and shalt be
hanged.&rdquo; The children then clapped
their hands, showed great marks of joy,
and finished their game by seizing the
supposed criminal, and carrying him
off as if to execution.</p>

<p>It is impossible to express how much
the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid admired
the wisdom and acuteness of the boy,
who had pronounced so just a sentence
on the very case which was to be pleaded
before him on the morrow. Taking his
eyes from the crevice, he rose, and asked
the grand vizier, who had been attending
to all that passed, if he had heard
the sentence given by the boy, and what
he thought of it. &ldquo;Commander of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>349]</a></span>
Faithful,&rdquo; replied Giafar, &ldquo;I am astonished
at the wisdom evinced by this
boy at so early an age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; resumed the caliph, &ldquo;do you
know that to-morrow I am to give my
decision on this very affair, and that
the true Ali Cogia has this morning
presented a petition to me on the subject?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I understand from your majesty,&rdquo;
replied the grand vizier. &ldquo;Do you
think,&rdquo; said the caliph, &ldquo;that I can give
a juster sentence than that we have now
heard?&rdquo; &ldquo;If the affair be the same,&rdquo;
returned the grand vizier, &ldquo;it appears
to me that your majesty cannot proceed
in a better manner, nor give any
other judgment.&rdquo; &ldquo;Notice well this
house, then,&rdquo; said the caliph, &ldquo;and
bring me the boy to-morrow, that he
may judge the same cause in my presence.
Order the cadi, also, who acquitted
the merchant, to be at the
palace, that he may learn his duty from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>350]</a></span>
this child, and correct his deficiencies.
I desire, too, that you will tell Ali Cogia
to bring with him his jar of olives, and
do you procure two olive merchants
to be present at the audience.&rdquo; The
caliph gave this order as he continued
his walk, which he finished without
meeting with anything else that deserved
his attention.</p>

<p>On the morrow the grand vizier repaired
to the house where the caliph had
been witness to the game the children
had played at, and he asked to speak to
the master of it, but he being gone out,
he was introduced to the mistress. He
asked her if she had any children; she
replied that she had three, whom she
brought to him. &ldquo;My children,&rdquo; said
he to them, &ldquo;which of you acted the
cadi last night as you were playing together?&rdquo;
The eldest replied that it
was he; and as he was ignorant of the
reason for this question, he changed
color. &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said the grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>351]</a></span>
vizier, &ldquo;come with me; the Commander
of the Faithful wishes to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother was extremely alarmed
when she saw that the vizier was going
to take away her son. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;is it to take away my son entirely that
the Commander of the Faithful has sent
for him?&rdquo; The grand vizier quieted her
fears by promising that her son should
be sent back again in less than an hour,
and that when he returned she would
learn the reason of his being sent for,
which would give her great pleasure.
&ldquo;If that be the case, sir,&rdquo; replied she,
&ldquo;permit me first to change his dress,
that he may be more fit to appear before
the Commander of the Faithful.&rdquo;
And she immediately put on her son a
clean suit.</p>

<p>The grand vizier conducted the boy
to the caliph, and presented him at the
time appointed for hearing Ali Cogia
and the merchant.</p>

<p>The caliph, seeing the child rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>352]</a></span>
terrified, and wishing to prepare him for
what he expected him to do, said to him:
&ldquo;Come here, my boy, draw near. Was
it you who yesterday passed sentence
on the case of Ali Cogia and the merchant
who robbed him of his gold? I
both saw and heard you, and am very
well satisfied with you.&rdquo; The child
began to gain confidence, and modestly
answered that it was he. &ldquo;My child,&rdquo;
resumed the caliph, &ldquo;you shall see
the true Ali Cogia and the merchant
to-day; come and sit down next to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The caliph then took the boy by the
hand, and seated himself on his throne,
and having placed him next to him, he
inquired for the parties; they advanced,
and the name of each was pronounced
as he touched with his forehead the
carpet that covered the throne. When
they had risen, the caliph said to them:
&ldquo;Let each of you plead your cause; this
child will hear and administer justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>353]</a></span>
to you, and if anything be deficient, I
will remedy it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ali Cogia and the merchant each
spoke in his turn; and when the merchant
requested to be allowed to take
the same oath he had taken on his first
examination, the boy answered that it
was not yet time, for it was first necessary
to inspect the jar of olives. At
these words Ali Cogia produced the jar,
placed it at the feet of the caliph, and
uncovered it. The caliph looked at the
olives, and took one, which he tasted.
The jar was then handed to some skilful
merchants who had been ordered to appear,
and they reported it as their opinion
that the olives were good, and of
that year&rsquo;s growth. The boy told them
Ali Cogia assured him they had been in
the jar seven years, to which the real
merchants returned the same answer
which the children as feigned merchants
had made on the preceding
evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>354]</a></span>
Although the accused merchant plainly
saw that the two olive merchants had
thus pronounced his condemnation, yet
he nevertheless attempted to allege reasons
in his justification; the boy, however,
did not venture to pronounce
sentence on him and send him to execution.
&ldquo;Commander of the Faithful,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;this is not a game; it is your
majesty alone who can condemn to
death seriously, and not I; I did it
yesterday only in play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The caliph, fully persuaded of the
treachery of the merchant, gave him
up to the ministers of justice to have
him hung; and this sentence was executed
after he had confessed where the
thousand pieces of gold were concealed,
which were then returned to Ali Cogia.
This monarch, in short, so celebrated
for his justice and equity, after having
advised the cadi who had passed the
first sentence, and who was present, to
learn from a child to be more exact in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>355]</a></span>
the performance of his office, embraced
the boy, and sent him home again with
a purse containing a hundred pieces of
gold, which he ordered to be given him
as a proof of his liberality.</p>
